## Supported versions of After Effects 

Duik should work correctly on all versions of After Effects since 2013 (CC). It will not work with CS6 and earlier versions.

# Installation

- Unzip the files you have downloaded.

You'll find several folders and files.

- *"LICENSE"* contains the license of Duik, the [GNU-GPL v3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html).
- The *Help* folder contains the documentation. Double click on the file "index.html" to open it.
- The *Tools* folder contains some useful scripts and other tools.
- The *ScriptUI Panels* folder contains the actual *Duik* script you need to install. A lot of different panels are available, you can install all of them or just pick the ones you need.

- There are several ways to install Duik very easily:  

## a. Copy the files

Copy all the files from the *ScriptUI Panels* folder to:

- Windows: `C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe After Effects CC\Support Files\Scripts\ScriptUI Panels\`  
- Mac OS: `/Applications/Adobe After Effects CC/Scripts/ScriptUI Panels`

You may need administrator privileges to install Duik this way. If you don't have them, see the other ways below.

!!! Warning
    With the other installation methods, some features using third party tools, like transcoding sound when exporting to Adobe Audition, may not work correctly.

## b. Shortcut for After Effects CC2018 and more recent

- Open After Effects  
- *Windows*: Holding the [Alt] and [Shift] keys, drag and drop the file `Duik Bassel.jsx` onto the project panel.  
- *Mac OS*: Holding the [Options] and [Shift] keys, drag and drop the file `Duik Bassel.jsx` onto the project panel.  

## c. Using the menu for After Effects CC2019 and more recent

- Open After Effects  
- Use the `File/Scritps/Install ScriptUI Panel...` menu to select and install `Duik Bassel.jsx`.  

- Restart After Effects and Duik will be available in the "Window" menu.

# Without installation 

You'll always be able to run Duik without even installing it. This is a good way to use it if you do not have administrator privileges on an older version of After Effects.

- Unzip all the files in any folder.  
- Launch After Effects, and start Duik via the `File/Scripts/Run script file...` menu.
