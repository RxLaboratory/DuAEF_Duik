Duik is a comprehensive animation and rigging tollset for Adobe After Effects. It provides the main rigging tools , found in any 3D software, like IK, controllers, and bones, which you can use in any 3D software, but adapts them to 2D animation in After Effects. With Duik you can rig complex characters and use advanced animation techniques usually used in 3D softwares. If you do not know what \u201crigging\u201d means, it may be because it is a bit too soon for you to use those tools. Please refer to the section entitled \u201c Should I use Duik? \u201d. Duik has plenty of animation tools too - managing keyframes and interpolations, traditional animation, animation exposure\u2026 - and automations too, like wiggle, spring, swing, wheel, etc. which allow you to animate more quickly and easily. Duik also has some other useful tools, such as camera controls, that are not solely tied to animation but can be really useful for both animators and riggers. Duik\u2019s comprehensiveness and ease of use have made it a script used in numerous movies across the world. Why is it called Bassel? Learn why this version of Duik is called Bassel .

In a composition, you can have several animations, one after each other. The animation blender is a simple controller (a layer) where you add markers which will trigger these animations. The animation blender is able to blend the animations together during transitions right after a marker, and it\u2019s also able to loop the animations after they have been triggered, if you need. Hint Once the animation blender have been set up, a simple tool in the Animation panel (Tools tab) of Duik can be used to easily set the markers to trigger animations. There are two things which need to be set up: the animations (the animated properties), and the Blender controller itself. The first part of the panel allows to quickly set the animations, while the second part is used to set the Blender up. Animations setup As soon as you have animated what you want to trigger, you have to set some markers in the composition to define when these animations begin and end. Each marker must have a name (which can be whatever you want), and a duration which is exactly the duration of your animation. Warning With versions of After Effects more recent than 14.0 (CC2017), these markers can be set on the composition itself, but with older versions, they have to be set on a layer named exactly \u201cDuik | Animation blender\u201d. To help you to set these markers, you can set their name in Duik, and then click the \u201cSet\u201d button. This will create a marker where it should be, using the work area of the composition to set its time and duration in a single click. Blender Setup Setting the composition up for the Blender is easy: Select the composition containing the animations you want to set up in the menu. You can use the eyedropper to quickly get the active composition. Select the composition from where you want to animate using the Animation Blender. It can be the same composition as the rigged one if you wish. You can choose to rig all animated properties, or only the selected ones. Setting only the selected properties up allows to have several controllers for the same composition, thus allowing to rig very complicating things\u2026 Click on the \u201cBlend!\u201d button to set everything up. Use To use the blender, you just have to add markers with the name of the animation on the controller layer. Each marker will trigger the corresponding animation. Caution Their name have to be exactly the same, and it is case sensitive. A simple tool in the Animation panel (Tools tab) of Duik can be used to easily set these markers, but you can also do it directly inside After Effects (see the shorcuts below). There are a few options in the effects of the controller, to loop the animation, and to control how they may blend during transitions. You can control if they have to blend, the duration of the transition (in seconds), and how it is interpolated. The blend happens after the marker triggering the animation, between the animation of the marker and the previous one. To temporarily disable the Blender, you can disable the effect on the controller. This makes it easy to add new animations or modifiy the existing ones. Shortcuts for markers in After Effects Caution Some of these shortcuts are not available in all versions of After Effects, but were added in the latest versions.

This makes it the cornerstone of the rigging process in Duik, which can be summarized to: Create Structures Auto-rig Animate As a smart tool, it will guess what you are trying to do, depending on the layers you have selected. It is able to add some \u201csimple\u201d IK or to rig a complete character in a single click. Note The Auto-rig is a tool in constant evolution. In each future version of Duik, it is going to work better and better, handling more different situations. To get started quickly with this process, just watch this jumpstart by Jake In Motion : Using the Auto-rig Select some layers in the composition . Click the \u201cAuto-rig & IK\u201d button. If there are Structures in the selection: If there are predefined limbs (arm, leg, spine or tail), the Auto-rig will rig everything for you, so you can start to animate right afterwards. If the Structures are custom Structures, the Auto-rig will add IKs to rig them, determining which type of IK would be the best according to the number and location of the layers. If the selection is made of standard layers , the Auto-rig will add IKs to rig them, trying to guess how they need to be rigged using their parenting and the location of their anchor points. If the layers are not parented yet, the Auto-rig is able to parent them automatically, but it\u2019s better in this case to select the layers in the right order: from the tip to the root of the limb (from hand to shoulder, or from foot to hip\u2026). IK and FK The most important constraints used by the Auto-rig to rig characters are IK and FK. Inverse Kinematics (IK) IK is a way to animate limbs by translating a controller located at the tip of the limb (i.e. at the hand or at the foot). This means that animating with IK uses positions, which are interpreted into the rotation of each part of the limb. This seems very natural when one manipulates it, but it is actually an advanced process. It is invaluable when the hand, or the foot, have interactions with anything else (like the foot interacting with the ground when the character walks). IK are the only way to animate the position of the hips while keeping the feet stuck on the ground, or the hand against a wall. But as animating with IK means animating positions, it is actually not the easiest nor the smartest way to animate limbs . It\u2019s needed when there are interactions, but in any other case (most of the cases for arms), you should prefer animating with FK. Forward Kinematics (FK) FK is the most simple way to animate limbs: all parts are parented together, and you just have to animate the rotations of each parts. Rotation is way easier to animate than position: there\u2019s only one value, one axis, and you don\u2019t have to adjust trajectories, you can concentrate on the speed and eases only. Ususally, when animating with FK, the animator wants to add follow-through and overlap . As these are very common in animation, FK controls created with Duik include an automatic follow-through and overlap tool. IK / FK As both IK and FK can be useful, all IK created with Duik also include FK controls, and the animator can switch between FK and IK whenever he wants. The FK controls included in the IK effects even include an automatic follow-through and overlap . To make this process the easiest possible, an IK/FK Switch tool is provided with the animation tools . Controllers As opposed to previous versions of Duik, the Auto-rig in Duik Bassel is able to create any needed controllers to rig the selected layers, you do not necessarily have to create them yourself first. This being said, if you need or want to add and use a specific controller, you just have to include it in the layer selection before running the Auto-rig. It will automatically detect and use it. This is especially useful if, for example, you want to control two different IKs with the same controller. Tip Always have a look in the effects of the Controllers after having run the Auto-rig! Depending on what has been rigged, there may be a lot of options there. Additionnal panel The additionnal panel for the Auto-rig is divided in two parts: some options for the Auto-rig process itself, and some complementary tools ( Standard and Expert modes only). Options By default, the Auto-rig will \u201cbake\u201d the appearance of any Structure after it has rigged it. This is a way to improve performance in After Effects by removing all unneeded expressions, but it will prevent you from changing the appearance of the Structures after having run the Auto-rig. You can disable this option if you wish; baking the appearance of the Structures will still be possible through the Edit Structures panel (in Standard and Expert mode only). For long limbs (more than two or three layers), the autorig has to choose between standard IK, Bezier IK or FK. The default is FK - it is easier to achieve a nice and natural motion using the FK with overlap of Duik - but you may need IK in some cases, especially if the limb interacts with something else. For example if the dog\u2019s tail is caught in the door. Ouch. Complementary tools Hint Available in Standard and Expert modes only. The IK button may be needed in very special occasions when the Auto-rig is not able to automatically create IK. There is an additionnal panel for the IK to let you choose how the IK for three layers have to be made: 1 and 2-layer IK (the default option) creates a combination of a one-layer and two-layer IK to rig the three layers with only one controller. This is the preferred way of rigging complex limbs like quadrupeds legs, as it allows a lot of controllers over each part of the limb. 3-layer IK creates a single IK for the three layers, which may seem easier to manipulate, but which is more limited in use. Bezier IK creates a Bezier IK without using the Auto-rig. In normal situations, as soons as there are more than two layers, the Auto-Rig will create a Bezier IK, but in some cases you may need some Bezier IK for only one or two layers; in this case, you can use this tool instead. FK Overlap rigs a chain of layers with a rotation controller (FK) with automatic follow-through and overlap. This is very useful for tails, hanging ropes, fabric\u2026","title":"Autorig & IK"},{"location":"autorig/#auto-rig","text":"The Auto-rig in Duik Bassel is a versatile and smart tool which adapts to a lot of different situations.

For long limbs (more than two or three layers), the autorig has to choose between standard IK, Bezier IK or FK. The default is FK - it is easier to achieve a nice and natural motion using the FK with overlap of Duik - but you may need IK in some cases, especially if the limb interacts with something else. For example if the dog\u2019s tail is caught in the door. Ouch.","title":"Options"},{"location":"autorig/#complementary-tools","text":"Hint Available in Standard and Expert modes only. The IK button may be needed in very special occasions when the Auto-rig is not able to automatically create IK. There is an additionnal panel for the IK to let you choose how the IK for three layers have to be made: 1 and 2-layer IK (the default option) creates a combination of a one-layer and two-layer IK to rig the three layers with only one controller. This is the preferred way of rigging complex limbs like quadrupeds legs, as it allows a lot of controllers over each part of the limb. 3-layer IK creates a single IK for the three layers, which may seem easier to manipulate, but which is more limited in use. Bezier IK creates a Bezier IK without using the Auto-rig. In normal situations, as soons as there are more than two layers, the Auto-Rig will create a Bezier IK, but in some cases you may need some Bezier IK for only one or two layers; in this case, you can use this tool instead. FK Overlap rigs a chain of layers with a rotation controller (FK) with automatic follow-through and overlap. This is very useful for tails, hanging ropes, fabric\u2026","title":"Complementary tools"},{"location":"bassel/","text":"Duik 16 will be called Bassel 16 will stay the version number of Duik, but, at Rainbox , we wanted to drop this number and give it a name, because this is not just an incrementation of Duik, it\u2019s been a complete re-writing of the code, everything has been re-thought and re-built for this version.

With the connector, a \u201cmaster property\u201d will drive one or several \u201cslave properties\u201d and automate their animation depending on the master property value. It is very useful in three cases: Every time you need a causal link between a property and some other properties. For example \u201cwhen the arm bends, the cloth has to adapt\u201d: this means you can use the connector to drive the shape of the cloth with the rotation of the forearm. It is very powerful to quickly connect sliders and other controllers to any properties, and for example control a head turn from a single value like the X position of a controller or a slider. You can use it to control opacities of layers with a single property, for example to control phonemes with the position of a controller. The child property has to be prepared with keyframes, and the master property will drive this animation a bit like if you were using time remapping on the slave property, in a similar way to the \u201cset driven keys\u201d in Autodesk Maya. When the master property value is at the predefined minimum, the child property value is the one at the start of its animation, and when the master property value is at the predefined maximum, the child property value is at the end of its animation. Property types handled by the connector As the connector uses the same principle as time remapping, it is able to connect almost any type of property to any other type of property, which makes it a very powerul tool, even on older versions of After Effects. The slave property can be of any type which can be animated with keyframes and have an expression (numerical and spatial values, shapes, texts\u2026) The master property must be of a type which is numerical (but can be multi-dimentionnal), like sliders, angles, position, scale, colors\u2026 How to set the connector up It is advised to first add the needed keyframes on the slave property, though this can be done or modified afterwards. Just animate the slave property as you need it to change when the master property goes from its minimum to its maximum. a. Select the master property in the timeline, and click on \u201cPick Master Property\u201d. The name of the master property will be shown on the button. b. You can also use one of the 4 controllers of Duik espacially made to be used by the connector (the slider, the 2D slider, the angle and the spatial effector) Depending on the type of the master property, you can select the axis (or the channel if it\u2019s a color) to be used to control the slave properties. Choose between the value or the velocity of the master property to control the slave properties. Using the velocity can be very useful for example to control how the antenna of a car rotates depending on the speed of its X position. Set the minimum and maximum value of the master property. Click either on \u201cConnect to selected properties\u201d or \u201cConnect to selected layers opacities\u201d. The latter can be used to control the display of a bunch of layers with a slider: it\u2019s a good way to switch predefined phonemes for a mouth with a controller for example. It is exactly like using time remapping on a composition containing a layer sequence, but without all the issued caused by using actual time remapping. After these few steps, everything is ready: as soon as the master property changes, the slave properties will be driven. You can change all the settings afterwards in the effects of the master layer. If you need to adjust the keyframes on the slave properties, you can temporarily deactivate the connector by disabling the corresponding connector effect on the master layer. Examples Automating the cloth when the arm bends With an arm already rigged, made of shapes (either shape layers or masks on solids): Animate the rig so the arm is straight at the beginning of the comp, and bent at its maximum a couple seconds later. If it\u2019s possible, animate only the FK of the forearm so the animation is the most simple possible, and to isolate the effect of the forearm on the cloth only, as its just a reference to draw the shape of the cloth. Animate the shape(s) of the arm and forearm so the cloth looks nice during the whole animation. Feel free to add as many keyframes as needed and use eases! Select the rotation property of the structure of the forearm. This is the property which exposes how the arm is bent, no matter what, in FK as in IK. Click on the \u201cPick master property\u201d button of the panel of the connector. Set the minimum to the rotation value of the structure of the forearm at the beginning of the composition, when the arm is straight. Set the maximum value to the rotation value of the structure of the forearm at the end of the animation, when the arm is completely bent. Select the shape(s) used to draw the cloth (and now animated). Click on the \u201cConnect to properties\u201d button. Now you can remove the animation of the arm (but NOT the animation of the shapes which is needed by the connector) You\u2019re all set! Now you can animate the arm as you wish, the cloth will correctly adjust. Controlling a head turn With a precomposed head: Animate anything you need to turn the head from left to right in the precomposition of the head. a. To control this head turn, we will not use an existing property, but create a nice controller just for it: b. Go to the main composition, from where you will animate the head c. In the panel of the connector, click on the \u201cSlider\u201d button Select ALL the animated properties of the head turn in the precomposition of the head. Click on the \u201cConnect to properties\u201d button. That\u2019s it! Now when you move the slider from left to right, the head turns! Controlling phonemes for a mouth You can connect the position of a controller to phonemes. You must have one layer for each phoneme: Select the controller\u2019s position Click on the \u201cPick master property\u201d button of the panel of the connector. Set the minimum value corresponding to the position of the controller where the first mouth must be displayed. Set the maximum value corresponding to the position of the controller where the last mouth must be displayed. Select the mouth/phonemes layers. Click on the \u201cConnect to opacities\u201d button of the connector. Et voil\u00e0! Move the controller to change which phoneme is displayed. Tip You can add a background behind the controller showing all the phonemes to know what you are selecting.

Framing Guides in the Camera panel: creates handy guides in the composition to help your framing and image composition (safe frames, thirds, fibonnacci, isometric perspective\u2026) Parent accross comps is a simple way to parent a layer to another one in a parent composition, or in a precomposition, using locators and expressions. 2D Camera : new controls for predefined behaviours. Easily simulate a shoulder mount, a camera hold by hand, or on a tripod, with shake controls. Re-implemented the translation framework, and added French translation. It is now possible to add new translations to Duik. More details about this will be available on the wiki soon. Re-implemented Export to Audition from Duik 15. Export to Audition now transfers audio levels keyframes too! Improvements Wiggle : you can now control the complexity of the wiggle (octaves and mutliplier) and manually set a Random Seed to keep the same wiggle accross layers. UX/UI tweaks and improvements, stability improved. Fixes Effector set to infinite line is no longer reversed. Changing colors of controllers with Duik no longer freezes Duik. Locking In and Out ease in the animation panel now automatically adjust values according to the latest modification (on In or Out ease). Fixed the bad issue where sometimes the After Effects dialog windows would freeze Duik (and all the other scripts), and then display the \u201cCan not run a script while a modal dialog is waiting for response\u201d error when trying to launch any script again (based on an idea by Lars Jandel ). 16.0.0-Alpha-9 New Walk Cycle : the first procedural animation is available. The keyframe types button in the Animation panel can now be used to create keyframes on all animated properties. Extract controllers automatically from a precomp to your main composition, and animate outside of the precomposed character. Scale, flip, flop the character as you need. With After Effects > 15.1, extracted controllers can use Master Properties to be able to animate several instances of the same rig, in the same project. The Auto-rig is now smart enough to detect what you need if you\u2019re applying it to something else than predefined Structures . The IK and FK buttons have been removed from the Rookie UI mode, and moved into the Auto-rig options in the Standard and Expert modes. A new automation, the Looper allows to add both a loopIn and a loopOut on several properties at once, and control them with an animatable effect. The loops can be of the standard three types: \u201cCycle\u201d, \u201cOffset, \u201cPing Pong\u201d, and \u201cContinue\u201d. The Effector now has two modes: Circle or Infinite line . You can now import your traditionnal animations from Krita , just export them as CSV! Improvements Huge performance improvement. A lot of work have been made to make Duik run faster (especially the Structure creation and Autorig). Structures , Bones , and Controllers are now created with their quality set to \u201cDraft\u201d to improve performance in After Effects. FK Overlap now has individual controls for layers. FK Overlap option to (not)inherit the rotation of the parent layer. FK Overlap over IK. When an IK is created, the checkbox to deactivate IK activates individual FK controls as well as a Follow-Through & Overlap control. Added a checkbox to show/hide handles for the curvation of Bezier IK . They are now hidden by default. Added an individual control for the toes rotation in the Foot roll Add Bones is smarter: it will search for properties (with a priority for puppet pins) if there are no property selected. Add Bones adds nice effects when used on shapes, to allow the deletion of unneeded control layers afterwards. You can use an Orientation Constraint to create what was called the IK Goal in Duik 15, with much more possibilities. You can now link dimensions when using the Random tool on values. The data displayed in the IK effects is improved. The IK length is now computed in FK too, to be able to use it with the connector more reliably than using the Structure rotation. The Connector now automatically populates the \u201cmin\u201d and \u201cmax\u201d values based on the actual animation of the master property. A lot UI adjustments and improvements Fixes FK Overlap now working correctly with a parent. Bezier IK curve controller now created at a correct size, depending on the settings of the controllers. Walk Cycle now works better when there\u2019s no layer selected. The Auto-Rig for legs with foot roll now works when the structures have been rotated before running the Auto-Rig . The Search and Replace tool has been fixed. 16.0.0-Alpha-8 New Rookie Mode : An easy-to-use interface for beginners. Note: Duik will automatically switch to this mode on first start, go to the settings to set it again to standard or expert mode. Animation: IK/FK Snap and switch. Improvements IK (2 and 3 layers): rotation values are improved to prevent a \u201cjump\u201d in some cases. The rotation value on the upper part of the limb will now have a 360\u00b0 jump in the opposite direction than its orientation when the IK is created. IK (2 and 3 layers): the \u201creverse\u201d option in the effec of the controller have been moved unearthed to be more accessible. Structures : Use Alt+Click to assign a random color on creation. Bones : Use Alt+Click to assign a random color on creation. Bones : Use Ctrl+Click to create bones for vertices only, and not tangents (Quicker in case the shape does not use tangents). UI Tweaks. Lots of invisible tweaks. Some performance improvements (especially with some expressions in the Structures). Fixes List : no more error when applying on a spatial property (but spatial tangents will be lost) FK Overlap now works better even when the root has a parent. 16.0.0-Alpha-7 New FK Overlap tool, very useful for tails and ropes (or even arms)! 16.0.0-Alpha-6 New Re-implemented tools from Duik15: Camera Rig , Scale Z-Link , Import TVPaint Camera The Auto-rig now rigs tails. The Auto-rig now rigs digitigrades (cats and dogs\u2026). The Auto-rig now rigs ungulates (cattle, sheeps\u2026). Improvements Controllers scale locked on creation Controllers new shapes available Controllers : Slider , 2D Slider and Angle controllers now split in two layers: the actual control and a background. No more need to double click to animate them. Randomize UI updated to new UI style Expert Mode UI improvements Structures rotation and scale are now reset to 0 and 100% before applying IK/autorig Fixes Bezier IK not selecting the controller at the end of the creation. Bezier IK handles now working even when guides are hidden Orientation Constraint now working even if the constrained layer has a parent. 16.0.0-Alpha-5 New WonderUnit Storyboarder file import Implemented 2D Camera (renamed the 2D Multiplane from Duik 15) 2D Camera: Ability to add a layer (just duplicate any existing layer) Implemented the Autorig (legs, arms, spine but not tails or custom structures/layers yet) Improvements User Interface has been polished | The Expert mode might still have some issues which will be fixed later Layers created by Duik are now tagged with a marker. The marker can be renamed by the user, but cannot be removed: some data is stored internally to help Duik identify the layers and compute stuff. Fixes Bezier IK the \u201ccurve\u201d controller is now a position controller. Removed the Attachment Constraint which did not work as expected. Use the other constraints instead. 16.0.0-Alpha-4 Prepared Wonder Unit Storyboarder file import. 16.0.0-Alpha-3 New Animation Kleaner to clean the keyframes. Includes the Smart interpolations and Spatial Interpolations tools from previous Alpha versions. Connector able to connect to \u201cfake\u201d layer sequences using layer opacities (very powerful tool) Improvements UX: (clicking on the tab buttons sets the default panel - closes the current tool - for the tab) Connector UX/UI small improvements UI: Improved animation panel (separated keyframe tools and animation tools) Better naming conventions for controllers, bones, structures\u2026 Fixes Effector now works when re-using an existing controller layer. Randomize for properties and keyframes Connector when connecting a parent with an expression. Connector when connecting shapes and other unusual properties. IK when the root has a parent Bones on shapes with CC2018 16.0.0-Alpha-2 New Keyframe selection tool (in the animation tab) to easily batch select keyframes by type or by layers. Re-implemented tools from Duik 15: Rename , Search and replace , Measure . Improvements Simplification of the usage of the slider , 2D slider and angle controllers: the effect on the layer has been simplified and some explanations added; a keyframe is automatically added on the right property.

Frequently Asked Questions General Can I use Duik Bassel on After Effects XX? (replace XX by any version name) Can I keep (or safely remove) the older versions of Duik (15)? What is this ffmpeg file provided with Duik Bassel? After Effects shows an expression error saying Unterminated string constant when renaming layers or puppet pins. Duik\u2019s user interface does not display correctly (it\u2019s cropped), I can\u2019t see all of it, what should I do? It seems I have missing buttons and tools in Duik, compared to what I can see in tutorials, screenshots, etc. Where are they? Changes between Duik Bassel, Duik 15 and older versions Duik 15 came with an installer, Duik Bassel is just a zip, why? The Duik 15 installer included Dugr too, where can I find it now? Where is the Rotation Morph? Where is the Orient to path tool? Where is the IK Goal? Where is the hand goal checkbox? Rigging How can I scale a rigged character in Duik Bassel? What can I do to make Duik work better with imported vector layers (illustrator, SVG, flash\u2026) with continuous rasterization activated? When using some tools, this alert is shown: Internal Verification Failure: Unexpected match name searched for in group\u201d ( 29::0 ), what can I do? Animation When applying the walk cycle, the controllers of the hands seem to be deactivated, why\u2019s that? General Can I use Duik Bassel on After Effects XX? (replace XX by any version name) Duik Bassel has been tested and works on all versions since CS6. That means CS6, CC, CC2014, CC2015, CC2017 and CC2018 support Duik. We do not test Duik on versions older than CS6, so it may or may not work properly, we don\u2019t know ;) But you can test it yourself, it won\u2019t break anything! Note Although Duik works well on older versions of After effects, some features may be deactivated, like some tools working with B\u00e9zier paths only on CC2018 and newer. If you need older versions of Duik which work with earlier versions of After Effects, you can get them there: https://github.com/Rainbox-dev/DuAEF_Duik/tree/master/Release/Duik The 10th version even works with After Effects 7.0! Can I keep (or safely remove) the older versions of Duik (15)? Duik Bassel can be installed along with Duik 15 or any other older version, it will not replace them, and you can continue to use both without any issue. However, if you don\u2019t need Duik 15 anymore, you can safely remove it: just delete all files with \u201cduik\u201d in their names in the ScriptUI Panels folder of After Effects, except Duik Bassel.jsx which is the only one needed by Duik Bassel. What is this ffmpeg file provided with Duik Bassel? ffmpeg is another free software for decoding, encoding and transcoding media files. It is needed by Duik Bassel for some specific features, especially the Export to Audition function which is able to transcode audio files, thanks to ffmpeg. After Effects shows an expression error saying Unterminated string constant when renaming layers or puppet pins. This is a known isse when using After Effects versions older than CC2017 on Mac OSX Sierra or more recent. If you rename elements using the Rename tool of Duik it should work correctly. This has been fixed in After Effects CC2017. Duik\u2019s user interface does not display correctly (it\u2019s cropped), I can\u2019t see all of it, what should I do? This is a bug in After Effects CC and CC2014 with windows and HiDPI screens (bigger than FullHD, 1920*1080), Duik can not do anything about it. There are three workarounds: Set the scaling of the display to 100% in the Microsoft Windows settings. Run Duik from the menu \u201cFile/Scripts/Run script\u2026\u201d in After Effects, instead of the \u201cWindows\u201d menu. But in this case, Duik won\u2019t be dockable. Update After Effects It seems I have missing buttons and tools in Duik, compared to what I can see in tutorials, screenshots, etc. Where are they? Duik Bassel has three user interface modes, and the default one, the Rookie mode does not include the most advanced tools; it is designed to be easy-to-use but powerful enough to rig and animate any kind of characters. If you\u2019re a beginner with Duik, you should not need the most advanced tools. To change the mode of the user interface and switch to Normal or Expert mode, go to the settings panel. Changes between Duik Bassel, Duik 15 and older versions Duik 15 came with an installer, Duik Bassel is just a zip, why? Duik Bassel is so simple to install, it does not need an installer any more. Read the installation instructions . The Duik 15 installer included Dugr too, where can I find it now? Dugr is available on the Rainbox website . Where is the Rotation Morph ? The Rotation Morph is replaced by the new Connector which is able to do exactly the same stuff, plus many more. Where is the Orient to path tool? This tool has been removed as you can achieve the same thing natively in After Effects, in the \u201cGeometry/orientation\u201d options of the layers. Where is the IK Goal ? The IK Goal is replaced by the new Orientation Constraint which is able to do exactly the same stuff, plus many more. To create what was the IK Goal , simply add an empty orientation constraint to the layer. To connect its rotation to a controller like what the IK Goal did when you had a controller selected, modify the constraint on the layer to constrain it to the controller you want. Where is the hand goal checkbox? This checkbox was removed, as the \u201cEnable IK\u201d option in the effect of the IK is already connected to the \u201cgoal\u201d behaviour of the hand. After a lot of tests, we came to the conclusion that the goal was needed only in IK and not needed in FK, so the easier way to (de)activate it was to link it to the IK button too. Anyway, if you need to disable it but keep the IK active, you just have to add a Null object onto the end of the structure and link it to the forearm. Then, link the hand to this null object. To control the rotation with the controller, you can also add an small expression in the null\u2019s rotation: value + pickWhipToTheControllerRotation Rigging How can I scale a rigged character in Duik Bassel? It is not possible to scale the rig itself yet without adjusting some expressions, but : We\u2019re still working on this, and still have hope that in a future version of Duik you\u2019ll just have to scale the controllers. With the new \u201cExtract Controllers\u201d feature, you can already scale a rigged character: Add the rigged comp into another comp. Select the precomposition layer and, in the controllers panel of Duik, click on \u201cExtract controllers\u201d You can then animate from outside of the precomp, with the extracted controllers, AND you can scale the precomposition layer to scale the rig (the controllers will follow). We think this is a good workaround, you just have to take care of the resolution as it\u2019s a precompositon (and rasterization may not work properly with the rig), scaling up will damage it a bit, but scaling it down is ok. What can I do to make Duik work better with imported vector layers (illustrator, SVG, flash\u2026) with continuous rasterization activated? After Effects\u2019 puppet tool (and Duik bones) is a pixel tool, but using continuous rasterization is using vector layers, so this raises some issues which are difficult to work around. IK have to work with coordinates of the layers, and continuous rasterization may mess up those coordinates too\u2026 However, the best you can do is converting those illustrator layers into shape layers (right click on the layer), which work better with the puppet tool and Duik. You can just precompose those layers too, while scaling them up in the precomposition to keep the quality of vectors. When using some tools, this alert is shown: Internal Verification Failure: Unexpected match name searched for in group\" ( 29::0 ) , what can I do? This is a bug in After Effects CC2014 and CC2014.1, it is not an issue from Duik. Update After Effects to CC2014.2, or upgrade to a newer version. Animation When applying the walk cycle, the controllers of the hands seem to be deactivated, why\u2019s that? The procedural walk cycle animates the arms with Forward Kinematics (FK) and thus deactivates the Inverse Kinematics (IK). They do not need to translate anymore as the animation is on the angles of the individual FK controls. If you want to animate/adjust the arms, you can either adjust the values in the Individual FK controls in the effects of the controllers, or you can re-enable the IK, but this will deactivate the procedural animation on the arms. Note You can animate the switch between IK and FK, and Duik provides a tool to ease this IK/FK switch process.","title":"F.A.Q."},{"location":"duik-faq/#frequently-asked-questions","text":"If you don\u2019t find the answer to your question here, come and ask for help on the official forum or on Discord !

Duik has plenty of animation tools too - managing keyframes and interpolations, traditional animation, animation exposure\u2026 - and automations too, like wiggle, spring, swing, wheel, etc. which allow you to animate more quickly and easily. Duik also has some other useful tools, such as camera controls, that are not solely tied to animation but can be really useful for both animators and riggers.

Take a look at the frequently asked questions if you don\u2019t find a solution to your issue in this user guide. If you\u2019re still stuck, come and ask for help on the official forum or on Discord ! How Duik works Duik is a script, this means all it does is automating things. It does nothing you could not do by yourself in After Effects (if you had time to do some very tedious work). This has two important meanings: A project rigged or animated with Duik can be opened with any installation of After Effects even if Duik is not installed. Duik uses only tools and techniques already existing in After Effects. Note This is not 100% true as the latest versions of Duik include ffmpeg , a free media encoder, used to transcode audio when exporting to Audition. In the future, it is possible that Duik include more third-party tools like that for specific features. The User Interface of Duik The goal of a tool like Duik is to make the life of animators (and riggers) easier. The priority was to make Duik as easy to learn as possible , while keeping it very quick to use . The other important goal was to make the interface as small as possible, so it won\u2019t take much place in the After Effects interface; we think it\u2019s very important to be able to focus on the timeline and the viewport of the application, without any other tools interfering when you\u2019re animating. To achieve this, we\u2019ve made Duik smarter. Almost all tools can be used in a single click , without any configuration step before, letting Duik make the best choice depending on what you\u2019re doing, what are the selected layers, etc. Most of the rigging process can be reduced to two clicks in Duik Bassel! First click: create a complete humano\u00efd Structure. Second click: Auto-rig the whole Structure. And this is done without any configuration step or other click in Duik. If you feel this is not enough, a nice procedural walk cycle is just another click away\u2026 User Interface (UI) As any modern script in After Effects, Duik has the form of a panel which can be docked with other native After Effects panels and third party tools (provided it was correctly installed and launched from the \u201cWindow\u201d menu of After Effects). The User Interface has been designed with these main ideas: Keep it close to the form of the user interface of After Effects Using controls similar to the native controls of After Effects helps the user get started quickier. But it was not possible, for specific features and for performance and stability reasons, to make everything exactly the same as in After Effects and controls differ a bit. The idea is that Duik must not stand out too much when docked with other After Effects panels. Do not use popups, windows and dialogs With very rare exceptions, everything Duik needs to display will be displayed in its main panel (with the exception of the Help Panel, which needs to be visible at any time), it won\u2019t use dialogs and other windows, so you know where to find informations, and you\u2019re not distracted by popups. Also, there are no blocking windows (what\u2019s called \u201cModal Dialogs\u201d), to keep an agile workflow. Keep the UI as small as possible What is important when working with graphics is the viewport. Duik is as small as it can be so it won\u2019t interfere with your workspace. Categorization Duik is a comprehensive tool set for rigging and animation. This means there are a lot of tools available, but they are categorized in some useful panels, depending on what you\u2019re doing (animating, rigging, using cameras\u2026) Each panel can be displayed by clicking on one of the top buttons. The first button, on the left, opens a very simple yet useful notes editor . The other buttons display the available panels: Rigging Animation Camera Import and Export tools Settings Help User Experience (UX) For every feature in Duik, the goal is to have a consistent workflow, the fastest possible, the easiest possible. Most of the tools work this way: 1. Select layers, properties or keyframes in the timeline of After Effects 2. a. Click on the button of the tool you need b. For some tools, a secondary panel is displayed to ask some other needed information 3. Watch Duik work (Actually, you won\u2019t, as for performance reasons most of the work remains hidden from the user, sorry ;) ) To be able to work in a single click, the tools need to be smart enough to take some decisions depending on what you\u2019re doing. Of course, Duik does not want you to be or feel limited to what you can do. Although most of the tools work in a single click, some of them are accompanied with a little \u201ccircle\u201d button. This means there are options you can change for the future use of the tool, which you can access by clicking on the circle. Duik can also be personnalized through some settings so you can adadpt it to your tastes, even if you have very bad tastes. What Duik does in After Effects The After Effects features mainly used by Duik are: Expressions Layers creation Custom effect Expressions (Almost) Every time Duik adds an expression, the expression begins with a comment to let you know what the expression is and does. Layers Although Duik uses existing layer types in After Effects (mostly shape layers and null objects), the layers it creates have a specific use and can be considered as new layer types. Layers created by Duik have a marker at their beginning, showing how Duik uses them (their \u201cDuik Type\u201d), and containing important data that Duik needs to work with them. Do not remove these markers (but you can move them away, even before the beginning of the comp to hide them, if you find them annoying). The types defined by Duik are: - Controllers can be shape layers or null objects (depending on a setting in the controller editor panel). They are used to manipulate and animate compositions rigged by Duik. - Structures are shape layers used to actually rig characters and props. They should not be manipulated by the animator and can be hidden as soon as the riggoing process is finished. - Bones are shape layers which control spatial properties of effects or bezier shapes and masks. They are usually parented to Structures to be rigged and animated, but sometimes can be animated themselves just to control the position of an effect, or parent it to anything else. - Locators are null objects used to expose the absolute transformations of another layer in a composition, and to create links between layers and compositions. - (Spatial) Effectors are a special type of controllers used to drive properties and motion depending on spatial coordinates. There are other types of layers used by Duik, which are more specific to some tools. Custom effects Duik uses a lot of custom effects, which are more generally called Pseudo-Effects in the After Effects community, although this is not an official feature in After Effects. Pseudo-Effects are a hack to create nicer controls for expressions than the native After Effects \u201cExpression controls\u201d effects, but they do nothing more than controlling expressions too. It\u2019s a bit complicated to create them by hand in After Effects, but there are useful scripts which do this very easily like Pseudo Effect Maker . Duik makes a great use of them to create nice user-friendly controls in the effects of the controllers. Always have a look in the Effect panel of After Effects when you rig something with Duik! Removing Duik \u201ceffects\u201d When you need to remove something made by Duik, you have to understand that Duik did nothing more than creating layers, expressions and pseudo-effects. Each time you need to remove something, you just have to remove the expressions and pseudo effects created by Duik, and maybe the layers too. This can sometimes be a bit tedious, but future versions of Duik will include tools to automate this process.","title":"First look"},{"location":"first-look-at-duik/#first-look","text":"","title":"First Look"},{"location":"first-look-at-duik/#help","text":"If you need help, click on the top right button in Duik to open the contextual help , or hold the [Shift] button on your keyboard while clicking on any button to get some help .

Options You can select keyframes at a specific time or in a time range. The time can be the time of the playhead or a specific time, and the time range can be either the work area or a specific range. To set specific time and time range, you can click on the eyedropper to pick the current values from the playhead or the work area. You can use the filters to select the keyframes of a specific type or on specific layers only. Interpolations Just under the \u2018Select keyframes\u2019 button, there are several tools to quickly adjust the interpolations of the selected keyframes. The first line of buttons can be used to change the interpolation type of the keyframes, or add keyframes of the wanted type on the properties. With the first button on the left, you can switch between the \u2018Edit\u2019 mode and the \u2018Add key\u2019 mode. In Standard Mode (only), you can manage some interpolation presets, which store and reset velocity and ease. The two sliders and the percentage adjust the ease on the selected keyframes, while the value just below defines the velocity. Kleaner The Kleaner is a tool to automatically clean the selected animations. It is able to remove unneeded keyframes, clean the interpolations, etc. Description It works both on spatial interpolations and keyframe eases, in three default steps: Fix spatial interpolation: the Kleaner will detect spatial tangents which should not be there, for example when two successive keyframes are exactly at the same place but with tangents between them. Smooth temporal interpolations. The Kleaner will adjust the animation curves to make them as smooth as possible, automatically detecting the best velocities and eases. It works a bit like the Auto-Bezier feature in After Effects but\u2026 better. The Kleaner will remove all unnecessary keyframes, keeping the exact same animation but with less keys.

Additionnal Panel The additionnal panel is divided in three sections corresponding to the three steps of the \u201cKleaner \u201d process. Spatial Interpolations: The four leftmost buttons can be used to quickly change the tangents of several spatial keyframes at once. Check or uncheck the checkbox to activate or deactivate this step when you run the Kleaner Temporal interpolation smoothing: Use the two leftmost buttons to tell the Kleaner if the first and last keyframes of the animation have to be linear or with ease.

Use By default, the Copy and Paste tools will work exactly like the default copying and pasting in After Effects (except it works on several layers at once). If, when pasting, Duik can not find any corresponding layer to paste some properties, you will be prompted to choose (or ignore) the layers yourself. The dialog will show the names of the missing layers along with some selectors to set the layers where to paste the animations. Additionnal panel Some options make this tool very powerful and more than just a standard copy and paste process. You can choose between pasting absolute or relative values. \u201cAbsolute\u201d will paste the keyframes as they are, but \u201cRelative\u201d will offset the values before pasting, depending on the current values of the properties.

The process can be summarized in just a few words: Structure a. Create Structures b. Link layers Controls a. Auto-rig b. Constraints Animation To get started quickly with this process, just watch this jumpstart by Jake In Motion : Structures Structures are layers you can add in your composition which will drive the animations, like the rig of a real puppet. The process is very simple: create or import your design in After Effects, add Structures and move them to the right spots (the pivots of each limb). Then you can rig those Structures, instead of the design itself like in previous versions of Duik, and finally link the design layers to the corresponding Structure layers. This way, the rig you create is independant from the design. This means it\u2019s easier to adjust the design even after the rig has been made, or even to re-use the same rig with other designs. Also, this rigging process is easier to fix or change if ever you need to adjust it even when you\u2019re already in the process of animation. Controllers Using the autorig, and a set of constraints, what you end with are controllers to drive the animation. You animate the controllers, they drive the structures through the constraints, and voil\u00e0! Your character moves. Constraints The interaction between the controllers and the Structures, and between the Structures themselves, happens through some constraints . Some of them are the core tools of Duik since the first version, like IK which drive the bending of limbs, and the Bones which are used to control any spatial properties: puppet pins, the emitter of a particle effect, and, with CC2018 and newer versions of After Effects, any bezier value, like shapes or masks. There is also a whole new set of constraints to automate even more movements and make the animator\u2019s life very easier: it\u2019s now possible to animate parenting with the new Parent Link constraint, or to constrain a layer to a bezier path, to attach a layer to other layers using weights, etc. Automations As soon as your character is rigged, you can begin the animation, being helped by a lot of Automations . Automations are procedural animations and dynamics to quickly set the most common animations up and then focus on the characterization of your character.

There is also a whole new set of constraints to automate even more movements and make the animator\u2019s life very easier: it\u2019s now possible to animate parenting with the new Parent Link constraint, or to constrain a layer to a bezier path, to attach a layer to other layers using weights, etc.","title":"Constraints"},{"location":"rigging/#automations","text":"As soon as your character is rigged, you can begin the animation, being helped by a lot of Automations .

It\u2019s a very quick and simple way to get started with walk animations. A nice walk cycle is just a click away, but you can go into details and adjust the character height and weight, but also every individual limb parameter and precisely set how it walks\u2026 To use the walk cycle, you must have a rigged character. Hint In the Structures panel, [Alt + Click] on the \u201cHominoid\u201d button will create a complete biped with a demo walk cycle. Hint This walk cycle was made for bipeds, but you can achieve a quadruped walkcycle using two walk cycles: one for the front legs, shoulders, neck and head, and another one for the back legs and hips. You only have to animate the tail by yourself. To get started quickly with this process, just watch this jumpstart by Jake In Motion ! Setup Before creating the walk cycle, make sure the character is standing straight, with the arms along the body, in a natural pose. You will still be able to move the controllers after the walk cycle has been created to adjust the pose and the look of the walk, or even animate them above the automatic animation to adjust it. The walk cycle is not meant to create perfect and characteroized animation. It is a tool useful to get started quickly with walk animations which would need some tweaks to characterize them, or to animate quickly secondary, less important, characters. If the character was rigged by predefined limb Structures and the Auto-rig of Duik, using the walkcycle is pretty straightforward: Select all the controllers of the character Click on the \u201cWalk Cycle button\u201d If the character was rigged using custom Structures in Duik, or any other tool (Rubberhose, BAO Bones\u2026) or even custom expressions, you can also use the walk cycle, but you will have to make some easy connections: Select all the controllers of the character (the layers used to animate it, or which contain the effects needed to animate it) Open the additionnal panel for the Walk cycle Assign the layers to their corresponding limbs. The eyedropper will set the currently selected layer in the composition. a. Click on the \u201cCreate\u201d button b. Duik will try to link the properties of the controllers to the walk cycle, but if you are using custom rigs, it may not find them all, in this case, read the effect description below to see how you can connect them manually. The Walk Cycle can be adjusted in the effects of the walk cycle controller which has been created in the composition. Tip All controllers can still be animated, so you can add your own keyframes to adjust the animation to your taste or animate anything else. Feel free to move the controllers to adjust the pose of the character. Caution The procedural walk cycle animates the arms with Forward Kinematics (FK) and thus deactivates the Inverse Kinematics (IK). The position of the controllers of the armes do not influence the rig anymore, as the animation is made on the angles of the individual FK controls. If you want to animate or adjust the arms, you can either adjust the values in the Individual FK controls in the effects of the controllers, or you can re-enable the IK, but this will deactivate the procedural animation on the arms. Hint You can animate the switch between IK and FK, and Duik provides a tool to ease this IK/FK switch process. Effect The \u201cGeneral motion\u201d value can be used to start and stop the walk cycle. You can then animate the character as you would without the walk cycle tool to continue the animation before or after the walk. The \u201cMain parameters\u201d set the general information needed by the walk cycle to animate it correctly The \u201csecondary controls\u201d are used to tweak each individual limb motion The \u201cAnimation data\u201d is where you can connect custom controllers to the walk cycle, get data to use in your own expressions and rigs, and adjust some parameters needed for the computation. Main Parameters All parameters use the metric system for now. Future versions of Duik will let you choose between the metric system and imperial units. \u201cCharacter\u201d: sets the main traits of the character. Its height influences the frequency of the cycle (the apparent speed of the feet). Its weight mainly influences the accelerations and decelerations of the motion (the momentum). The energy controls the amplitude of the movements. The softness controls how the muscles are contracted or not. \u201cWalk Cycle\u201d: sets the characteristics of the walk. The walk speed adjusts the speed of the character. This parameters changes the amplitude of the steps - it does not change the frequency of the cycle which depends on the height of the character. To change the direction of the cycle, change the sign of the speed. You can choose between to walk cycle types: realistic is the most natural, and dancing adds a \u201cdouble bounce\u201d like Mickey Mouse. Secondary controls Here you can adjust how each individual limb moves. In this version of Duik, you can not control separately the left and the right, but if you need to differenciate each side, you can create two different versions of the walk cycle in the same composition, one for each side. You can adjust the swinging amplitude the limbs, their softness (how the muscles are contracted), etc. Do not hesitate to test each control individually to see how it affects the walk cycle. Animation data In this section you can adjust how the walk cycle is computed, connect your custom rig and controllers which Duik could not connect automatically, or get useful data for your own rigs and expressions. Animation This is where you can connect the properties of custom rigs and controllers. Each value in this section outputs the animation of the corresponding property on each limb. To connect the properties of your controllers, use the expression pickwhip to pick the corresponding animation property, and add \u2018+ value;\u2019 at the end of the resulting expression. The arms animmation uses FK, you need to connect them to angle properties. The feet animation uses IK, connect them to position properties. Parameters Duik tries to set some important parameters automatically when you create the walk cycle with some controllers selected, but if you are using a custom rig or if you connect controllers later, these properties may not be set properly. You can adjust them in this section. Duik needs to know the height of the legs of the character as displayed in the composition, in pixels, from the heel to the hips, when the character is standing. Duik also needs the height of the whole characer, in pixels, from the heel to the top of the head. Computation This section outputs some values used by Duik to compute the walk cycle. You can use them in your own expressions and rigs. One value is especially useful: the cycle duration, which is available in seconds or frames. To render perfect loops, you can set the work area or the composition duration to this value.","title":"Walk Cycle"},{"location":"walk-cycle/#walk-cycle","text":"The \u201cWalk Cycle\u201d is the first comprehensive procedural animation available in Duik Bassel.

This is a very useful tool if you are compositing traditionnal animation or trying to achieve a traditionnal look on CG animations. It can change the framerate of the composition or of the properties at any time, mixing framerates (what\u2019s called the \u201cexposure\u201d in traditionnal animation) in the same composition, for different layers or at different times. Setup You can use the X-Sheet either as an adjustment layer for the whole comp, or on properties. To use it as an adjustment layer, just click on the \u201cX-Sheet\u201d button. To add it on properties, select the properties before clicking in the button. Effect There are four ways to adjust the exposure of the animations / the compostion. By Frame Duration: This way, you just have to set the exposure with the \u201cFrame Duration\u201d value. For example, setting this value to 2 in a 24fps comp will run the animation at 12fps, setting in to 3 in the same comp will run it at 8fps. This value can be animated to change the exposure at any time. The three other methods do not use an exposure / framerate value, but keyframes or markers to set the times when the frame must change. This allows a very precise control on the exposure, and works like a X-Sheet in traditionnal animation. The \u201cX-sheet\u201d method uses keyframes on the \u201cX-Sheet\u201d value of the effect: it will change the frame at each keyframe on the checkbox, no matter the value of the checkbox itself (it does not matter to check or uncheck it, it is only the time of the keyframe which is used). The last two methods works the same way but using composition or layer markers instead of keyframes. The displayed frame will be changed at each marker time.

A Zero is a standard null object, which has exactly the same transform values as the layer it works with, and it is inserted in the hierarchy, between the layer and its former parent.
