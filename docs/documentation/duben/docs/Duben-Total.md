# Total

Duben compiles all the results in three scores:

* A total score, which is the easiest way to compare two After Effects versions, or two different hardware.
* A *Renderer* score, which compiles all the results which impacts the time taken to render frames.
* A *UX/UI* score, which compiles all the results which impacts the responsiveness of the User Interface of After Effects.

*Renderer* and *UX/UI* scores can vary a lot between different versions and hardware, these score can help you choose the best version of After Effects to work on, which may not be the same as the best version to render your compositions.

If you're working on compositing, you might prefer a better *renderer* score (lower value), instead of animators who may prefer a better *UX/UI* score.
