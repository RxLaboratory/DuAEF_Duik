# UI

To test the After Effects user interface, especially with a lot of layers, Duben creates a composition with a single Shape Layer, and then runs the "duplicate" commans a lot of times, selecting all the layers at each time the command is run. This allows to accurately how the User Interface of After Effects responds while using lots of layers or complex compositions, especially when the "show layer controls" option is checked.
