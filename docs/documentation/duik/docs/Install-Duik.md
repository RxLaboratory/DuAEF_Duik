# Installation

**1 - Download** Duik from the [official website](https://rainboxprod.coop/en/tools/duik/).


**2 - Unzip** the files you have downloaded.


**3 -** There are two ways to install Duik very simply:  

a. Copy all the files to:

- Windows: `C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe After Effects CC\Support Files\Scripts\ScriptUI Panels\`  
- Mac OS: `/Applications/Adobe After Effects CC/Scripts/ScriptUI Panels`  
You may need administrator privileges to install Duik this way. If you don't have them, see the second way below.

b. This method works only on the most recent versions of After Effects:  

- Open After Effects  
- *Windows*: Holding the [Alt] and [Shift] keys, drag and drop the file `Duik Bassel.jsx` onto the project panel.  
- *Mac OS*: Holding the [Options] and [Shift] keys, drag and drop the file `Duik Bassel.jsx` onto the project panel.

**4 - Restart** After Effects and Duik will be available in the "Window" menu.
