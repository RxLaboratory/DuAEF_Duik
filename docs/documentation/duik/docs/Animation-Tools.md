Duik Bassel includes some powerful tools you may need from time to time during the animation process.

- **[IK/FK Switch](../IK-FK-Switch)** is an easy way to switch between IK and FK during the animation, if the layers have been rigged by Duik Bassel.
- **[Animation Blender](../Animation-Blender)** is a nice shortcut to list and animate with markers on compositions previously rigged by the *[Animation Blender](../Animation-Blender-Setup)*.
- **[Motion Trail](../Motion-Trail)** displays the trajectory of any layer using a shape layer, and can make trails behind them. _(CC2018 and above only)_
- **[X-Sheet](../X-Sheet)** is a simple way to adjust the animation exposure of the properties, the layers or the whole composition.
- **[Time Remap](../Time-Remap)** is a quick way to activate time remapping on the layers while adding some useful expressions, like looping.
- **[Extract Controllers](../Controller-Tools/#extract-controllers)** will extract the controllers from the selected precomposition and copy them in the current composition, to be able to animate outside of the character precomposition.
- **[Cel Animation](../Cel-Animation)** is a tool to animate frame by frame using the paint effect in After Effects.
