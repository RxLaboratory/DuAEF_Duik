It provides the main rigging tools , found in any 3D software, like IK, controllers, and bones, but adapts them to 2D animation in After Effects. With Duik you can rig complex characters and use advanced animation techniques usually used in 3D softwares.

Duik has plenty of animation tools too - managing keyframes and interpolations, traditional animation, animation exposure, etc. - and automations too, like wiggle, spring, swing, wheel, etc. which allow you to animate more quickly and easily. Duik also has some other useful tools, such as camera controls , that are not solely tied to animation but can be really useful for animators, riggers and even compositors.

At the time we\u2019re writing this documentation, they\u2019re DuAEF , DuGR and DuIO . You may use this file if you plan to combine several different API using DuAEF , to be sure to include it only once. Using only Duik (and DuGR and DuIO) If you\u2019re only needing the Duik API, and perhaps the DuGR API or the DuIO API too, which are included in Duik, you just have to include DuAEF_Duik_api.jsxinc at the beginning of your own script. Here\u2019s an example. // Encapsulate everything to avoid global variables! // thisObj is either undefined (for stand alone script) or the panel containing the ui (for ScriptUI panel) (function(thisObj) { // If you only need Duik, just include DuAEF_Duik_api at the beginning #include \"Duik_api.jsxinc\"; Combining the Duik API with other APIs and DuAEF If you\u2019re going to include APIs other than Duik (or DuGR and DuIO which are already included in Duik), you\u2019ll need to include everything separately to be sure that all frameworks are included only once. In this case, include Duik_api.jsxinc and the other APIs at the beginning of your script. Here\u2019s an example: // Encapsulate everything to avoid global variables! // The parameter is either undefined (stand alone script) or the panel containing the ui (ScriptUI) (function(thisObj) { // If you need to combine Duik and other APIs like DuIO or DuGR // Include DuAEF first, and then stand-alone APIs #include \"libs/DuAEF.jsxinc\"; #include \"libs/DuGR_api.jsxinc\"; #include \"libs/DuIO_api.jsxinc\"; // Duik API is divided into several files to workaround ExtendScript limitations on included files #include \"libs/Duik_api_1.jsxinc\"; #include \"libs/Duik_api_2.jsxinc\"; #include \"libs/Duik_api_3.jsxinc\"; // Now you can also include any other API which also depends on DuAEF or one of the above APIs #include \"another_API.jsxinc\" Initialisation Just after you\u2019ve included the API, you have to run the DuAEF.init() method, to setup the framework: // Running the init() method of DuAEF is required to setup everything properly. DuAEF.init( \"YourScriptName\", \"1.0.0\", \"YourCompanyName\" ); DuAEF is the Duduf After Effects Framework , and is used by the Duik API. It is a (big) set of objects and methods to ease scripting for After Effects . Once DuAEF has bee initialised, you can set a few parameters to improve the UX: // These info can be used by the framework to improve UX, but they're all optional DuESF.chatURL = 'http://chat.rxlab.info'; // A link to a live-chat server like Discord or Slack... DuESF.bugReportURL = 'https://github.com/RxLaboratory/DuAEF_Dugr/issues/new/choose'; // A link to a bug report form DuESF.aboutURL = 'http://rxlaboratory.org/tools/duik'; // A link to the webpage about your script DuESF.docURL = 'http://duik.rxlab.guide'; // A link to the documentation of the script DuESF.scriptAbout = 'Duik: The comprehensive rigging and animation tool set'; // A short string describing your script DuESF.companyURL = 'https://rxlaboratory.org'; // A link to your company's website DuESF.rxVersionURL = 'http://api.rxlab.io' // A link to an RxAPI server to check for updates DuESF here refers to the Duduf ExtendScript Framework , which is used by DuAEF and the Duik API . It is another set of objects and methods to ease scripting for any Adobe application. Now everything is ready, you can add your own methods, and build the UI. For this, you can use DuScriptUI , a set of objects and methods to easily build nice UI with ExtendScript and its ScriptUI objects: // This will be our main panel var ui = DuScriptUI.scriptPanel( thisObj, true, true, new File($.fileName) ); ui.addCommonSettings(); // Automatically adds the language settings, location of the settings file, etc DuScriptUI.staticText( ui.settingsGroup, \"Hello world of settings!\" ); // Adds a static text to the settings panel DuScriptUI.staticText( ui.mainGroup, \"Hello worlds!\" ); // Adds a static text to the main panel // When you're ready to display everything DuScriptUI.showUI(ui); If, and only if you\u2019re not calling the DuScriptUI.showUI(ui) method, because you don\u2019t use DuScriptUI to build your UI for example, you have to call DuAEF.enterRunTime() before running any other function. // Note that if you don't have a UI or if you don't use DuScriptUI to show it, // you HAVE TO run this method before running any other function: DuAEF.enterRunTime(); Don\u2019t forget to close the anonymous function we\u2019ve created at the beginning to avoid global variables, and pass this so the script can be built in its own panel, if any. })(this); Complete example // Encapsulate everything to avoid global variables! // thisObj is either undefined (for stand alone script) or the panel containing the ui (for ScriptUI panel) (function(thisObj) { // If you only need Duik, just include DuAEF_Duik_api at the beginning #include \"DuAEF_Duik_api.jsxinc\"; // Running the init() method of DuAEF is required to setup everything properly.

Most of theses features are simple methods, sorted in a few namespaces to keep things tidy. For example, to run the arm auto-rig, just run the arm method from the Rig namespace of Duik : // Automatically rig the selected bones as an arm Duik.Rig.arm(); // Or you can pass an array of layers to the rigging methods Duik.Rig.leg( someLayers ); As another example, you can also add a wiggle effect to the selected properties, or some properties of your choice. The wiggle method is in the Automation namespace of Duik : // Add a Wiggle control with default options to the selected properties Duik.Automation.wiggle(); // Or you can set some parameters // 1. Separate dimensions // 2. Add one control per property (instead of a single control for all of them) // 3. An array of properties to setup Duik.Automation.wiggle( true, true, someProperties ); Of course, all these methods are fully documented; you can read the reference of the Duik namespace to learn all of them. This Duik namespace is divided in a few other categories to make things easier to find and use: Duik.Animation : The animator\u2019s toolkit (copy/paste animation, tween, snapKeys\u2026) Duik.Automation : The lazy animator\u2019s toolkit. (NLA, motionTrail, wiggle, random, walk cycle\u2026) Duik.Bone : Bone and armatures related tools. (leg, arm, bake\u2026) Duik.Camera : Camera toolkit. (frame, rig, twoDCamera\u2026) Duik.CmdLib : The Duik command line library. This is a specific namespace used by the Duik Command Line panel. Duik.Constraint : Constraints for rigging bones and layers. (twoLayerIK, oneLayerIK, bezierIK, orientation, parentAcrosscomp\u2026) Duik.Controller : Controller related tools. (create, bake\u2026) Duik.Layer : Layer related tools. (setLimbName, setCharacterName, select, sanitizeName\u2026) Duik.Pin : Pin related tools. (create, linkPathToLayers, linkPuppetPinsToLayers, addPins\u2026) Duik.Rig : (Auto)Rigging tools. (auto, arm, leg, fin, wing\u2026) Duik.Tool : Miscellaneous tools. (cropPrecompositions, editExpression\u2026) DuAEF, After Effects Framework DuAEF includes a lot of useful methods to help After Effects Scripting, and a few specific objects. They\u2019re all objects and namespaces which name start with DuAE . Example: // Get the active composition var comp = DuAEProject.getActiveComp(); // May be null if there's no active comp. if (comp) { // Add a 20 px wide null layer // Note that DuAEF uses a shape layer as null layer, // so it doesn't pollute the \"Solids\" folder of the project. var null = DuAEComp.addNull( comp, 20 ); } Some objects are available to make things easier. Especially with properties (to work around the dreaded invalid object from AE\u2019s strange behaviour). var comp = DuAEProject.getActiveComp(); var layer = comp.layer(1); var transform = new DuAEProperty( layer.transform ) // Replaces some text in all expressions of all properties in the \"transform\" PropertyGroup transform.replaceInExpressions(\"before\", \"after\"); // We can also select all keyframes for example transform.selectKeys(); // Or change the interpolation for all keyframes transform.setInterpolation( KeyframeInterpolationType.BEZIER ); Note In the future, namespaces like DuAEComp may be also available as wrappers, objects, like DuAEProperty . DuESF, ExtendScript Framework DuESF extends the default ExtendScript framework with useful objects and methods. For example, a set is available to ease the creation of UIs. // This will be our main panel var ui = DuScriptUI.scriptPanel( thisObj, true, true, new File($.fileName) ); ui.addCommonSettings(); // Automatically adds the language settings, location of the settings file, etc DuScriptUI.staticText( ui.settingsGroup, \"Hello world of settings!\" ); // Adds a static text to the settings panel DuScriptUI.staticText( ui.mainGroup, \"Hello worlds!\" ); // Adds a static text to the main panel DuScriptUI.button( ui.mainGroup, \"A Button\"); // Adds a button, which can have an icon // When you're ready to display everything DuScriptUI.showUI(ui); It also includes a lot of lower level objects and methods. Here are some examples. // COLORS var red = new DuColor([1, 0, 0, 1]); // alerts \"#ff0000\" alert(red.hex); // Get a darker red var darkerRed = red.darker(); // You can also create a color from hex var blue = DuColor.fromHex(\"#0000ff\"); // Or use a predefined color var aeBlue = DuColor.Color.AFTER_EFFECTS_BLUE; // MATH // Clamp a value (works also with a set of values) var clamped = DuMath.clamp( aValue, -5, 5); // Linear interpolation (or extrapolation) var interpolation = DuMath.linear( aValue, 0, 1, 12, 27); // Some useful functions are available var gauss = DuMath.gaussian( aValue ); var randomValue = DuMath.gaussRandom( 0, 10 ); // FILES // Get the first line of a text file var info = DuFile.readFirstLine( \"C:/a/path/file.txt\" ); // Save a JS object to a JSON file var obj = { one: \"A text\", two: [ \"an\", \"array\"] }; DuFile.saveJSON(obj, \"C:/a/path/file.json\" );","title":"Getting Started"},{"location":"advanced/api/getting-started.html#getting-started","text":"","title":"Getting started"},{"location":"advanced/api/getting-started.html#download-the-api","text":"The API and its documentation can be downloaded from RxLaboratory , or from a dedicated Github Repository .","title":"Download the API"},{"location":"advanced/api/getting-started.html#include-it-in-your-script","text":"Just save the two files Duik_api.jsxinc and DuAEF_Duik_api.jsxinc in the folder where you\u2019re working and writing your own script.

Create the file Let\u2019s assume you\u2019ve already downloaded the API , and saved it in the same folder where you\u2019re creating your headless script. Now, create a new text file with any text editor 1 , and name it using the .jsx extension, which is the usual extension for After Effects scripts. In this example, we\u2019re creating a script which will automatically parent all selected layers to the one selected at last, let\u2019s call it Auto-Parent.jsx . First, we\u2019re going to add what\u2019s is called an anonymous function . It\u2019s a standard function, but without any name. All the script will be written inside this function; this is a simple way to make sure everything stays contained and nothing leaks to the global space, which could break other scripts. This is how the script looks like with just this anonymous function: (function(){ })(); The first line creates the function, the last line closes and executes it. We\u2019re going to write the script in between. Include the API The first thing to do is to include the API with: #include \"DuAEF_Duik_api.jsxinc\" Note that this will work only if the API is located next to the script, in the same folder. If not, you can use a path 2 to the API instead of only the name. After the inclusion, we need to call the DuAEF.init function to prepare everything. DuAEF.init( \"Auto-Parent\", \"1.0.0\", \"Your (company) Name\" ); The three arguments are: A name for the script The version of the script Your name or the name of your company The code to run Now that everything is ready, we can write the actual code. If this wasn\u2019t a headless script, we would start by writing the User Interface, and then show it to the user. As it\u2019s not the case, we just need to tell the API we\u2019re going to run without UI. DuAEF.enterRunTime(); And now, let\u2019s do something! Our goal is to create a script which will parent all selected layers to the one which was selected last. Duik can do that for us, it\u2019s the autoParent function ! As Duik comes with many features, they\u2019re sorted in namespaces , which actually correspond to the panels of Duik. The Auto-Parent method is located in the Constraint panel and namespace. Duik.Constraint.autoParent(); And that\u2019s all! We\u2019ve finished the script. Note that the autoParent function can take one argument, to tell it to parent only orphans (i.e. the layers which do not have any parent yet). If that\u2019s what you want you could write Duik.Constraint.autoParent(true); instead. Almost all features of Duik are available as very simple functions in the API . The complete script This is the finished script, with some comments 3 to help you learn and understand. // First, create an anonymous function. // This is very important to make sure we don't leak anything // to the global space and won't break anything by mistake. (function(){ // Here we include the Duik API #include \"DuAEF_Duik_api.jsxinc\" // Running the init() method of DuAEF is required to setup everything properly. DuAEF.init( \"Auto-Parent\", \"1.0.0\", \"RxLaboratory\" ); // There's no User Interface, which would have to be built here. // Let's go right to the execution. // This method has to be run once before any other method from the API. DuAEF.enterRunTime(); // Run the Auto-Parent method // See: http://duik.rxlab.io/Duik.Constraint.html#.autoParent Duik.Constraint.autoParent(); // Close the anonymous function. })(); You can now use this script to assign a keyboard shortcut for parenting layers. We recommend Visual Studio Code , but it can be anything: Windows Notepad , Notepad++ , Brackets \u2026 It must not be a word processor though (like Microsoft Word or LibreOffice Writer ). \u21a9 It can be either an absolute path, which starts with a / on Mac or a drive letter like C:\\\\ or C:/ on Windows, or a relative path.

First, we\u2019re going to add what\u2019s is called an anonymous function . It\u2019s a standard function, but without any name. All the script will be written inside this function; this is a simple way to make sure everything stays contained and nothing leaks to the global space, which could break other scripts.

Our goal is to create a script which will parent all selected layers to the one which was selected last. Duik can do that for us, it\u2019s the autoParent function ! As Duik comes with many features, they\u2019re sorted in namespaces , which actually correspond to the panels of Duik. The Auto-Parent method is located in the Constraint panel and namespace. Duik.Constraint.autoParent(); And that\u2019s all! We\u2019ve finished the script. Note that the autoParent function can take one argument, to tell it to parent only orphans (i.e. the layers which do not have any parent yet).

Be annoying, be angry, be upset. Always create for the benefit of the people the instruments of their well-being, and you will have created the instruments of their power and emancipation. Jean-Baptiste Andr\u00e9 Godin When I started to develop my own software to help my own work in animation, it was just my own tools and nothing else. It was private and made my life better, it had no impact at all on other people\u2019s life. Well, to be honest, as I wasn\u2019t working alone, it quickly had a small impact on my colleagues, easing their processes too. And then, I decided I could share those tools with the rest of the world, if the rest of the world was interested. And it was. The most well known of my tools, Duik, is now downloaded 1000 times a day. Going from private to public made these tools political. I had to choose how they were going to impact other people\u2019s life. Everything is about choices What was I going to do? I had a new product, I could just sell it like almost everything else in our capitalist society, or even better, I could rent it to keep my customers as hostages. But I had a unique occasion to think about my own impact on the world. There are a lot of things I don\u2019t like in our society: individualism, consumerism, competition\u2026 Everything is connected, intertwined. Because our society is capitalist, it makes people individualist competitors and consumers. It\u2019s how things go. The question is: what will happen if we get really conscious of this? What will happen if we follow other paths? I chose to do things in a less common way, maybe even a rare way: I chose to give away my tools. I chose not to earn money with them, or at least, I chose to let people choose if it was worth paying for . I chose freedom, for myself, and for the rest of the world. I chose to let my tools open source, I chose to let people get, use, and modify them freely, instead of being worried of stealers and pirates. I chose to make my stuff available even for the poorest human being on earth. Because I think my choices can have an impact. Because I think that if I work outside of and against capitalism and consumerism, if I show a different path, the path may be followed , and maybe, maybe it\u2019s a step to what I think is a better world. Politics, that\u2019s just politics. One is ready to accept a lot of compromises 1 to be able to consume the easy way. But if one\u2019s been given the choice either to consume freely, or to donate time or money, one just consumes and nothing else. It\u2019s too easy to just download and use if it\u2019s \u201cfree\u201d, so much easier than making a donation first, or to contribute in any way. It would have been easy to sell my tools. It would have been easy not to give any choice to the users. But I chose a difficult path . I know that most people won\u2019t understand it, but I don\u2019t regret my choice , and I would do it again - even if I know I could be richer than I could ever have imagined - because it\u2019s more important for me to show that another world is possible, where people are free from property , where economy is subordoned to the well-being of all , where happiness comes from equality of all the people. This better world already exists and just need to be extended, that\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to show; you just have to join us. Consume less, share better. Herv\u00e9 Kempf Numbers Duik is a big success. Millions of downloads so far, an average of 1000 downloads per day , thousands of daily users. It\u2019s a big success, with very few supporters. 250 backers during each of the crowd-funding campaigns, 300 monthly or annual subscribers 2 and patrons 3 (and those groups are overlapping, we can\u2019t even add the numbers). It\u2019s a big success, with even fewer contributors. There are less than 10 meaningful contributors (to the code, the translations, the documentation\u2026). It\u2019s a big success, without earning even a single full-time salary in the country where it\u2019s developed (France). We estimate less than 4% of our daily users did contribute time or money to the project. It works, thanks to other ways of earning the missing money (selling tutorials and books for example). But imagine what we could do if more people contributed! If, for each download, we got a single US dollar, we would\u2019ve got millions to improve the world together! Despite the fact that Duik is useful to - and needed by - the society, there\u2019s no reward and it stays very hard to develop and maintain. Because in our capitalist world, we don\u2019t reward what\u2019s useful or needed; products are valued based on an abstract market value . Products have to be sold to be valued. That\u2019s how capitalism and mercantilism work, hand in hand. Property is the Right of Increase claimed by the Proprietor over any thing which he has stamped as his own. Pierre-Joseph Proudhon Consume less and contribute more I\u2019m not upset, I\u2019m not discouraged. On the contrary, because I did things differently, I thought differently, I achieved something different. Obviously, I don\u2019t do what I do for money \u2013 but unfortunately money is a need. Why so many efforts? Because I chose not to be only a consumer , but I wanted to be a contributor . I don\u2019t want to consume life, I want to contribute to the society, because I\u2019m the product of society and I have a great debt to it. Even the most wretched individual of our present society could not exist and develop without the cumulative social efforts of countless generations. Thus the individual, his freedom and reason, are the products of society, and not vice versa: society is not the product of individuals comprising it; and the higher, the more fully the individual is developed, the greater his freedom \u2014 and the more he is the product of society, the more does he receive from society and the greater his debt to it. Mikhail Bakunin I\u2019m not waiting for someone to sell me what I need, I try to build what I need and then share it, before someone else sells it . I want to be able to explain what I did to the society, and be proud of it. Selling my software would not have been a contribution to society, even if it\u2019s needed and successful, because it would not have pulled our community to what I think would be the right direction. It would only give me the sensation I did something which matters, but it would not have been really useful for the community. It\u2019s not enough to make useful things, what\u2019s important is what we do with them, how we make them , how we share them . This is my point of view, and it matters . It matters that I have a point of view , it matters that I say it out loud. It matters that creating free software is a political gesture for me, because this means I\u2019m contributing to the community , because it means I asked myself enough questions about what I was doing and how it would impact others. It\u2019s an effort, it\u2019s harder than being a simple consumer, it\u2019s less rewarding in the short term, but way more in the long run, because I can be proud. Not rich, but legitimately proud. What I want you to know, is that it\u2019s actually not so hard. Join us! Of course I had the luck of being able to do it, I had the luck to be born where I was born, to have had a little spare time at some point in my life, to have had a good education\u2026 But it\u2019s not just luck, it\u2019s also choices. Political choices , ethic choices. Everyone can ask questions, everyone can be angry at things, everyone can think about individualism and consumerism. Everyone can \u2013 and has to \u2013 be upset about our society. Everyone can do politics. The fate of the country does not depend on how you vote at the polls \u2014 the worst man is as strong as the best at that game; it does not depend on what kind of paper you drop into the ballot-box once a year, but on what kind of man you drop from your chamber into the street every morning. Henry David Thoreau Maybe you\u2019re already trying to change the world in your own way, or maybe you don\u2019t know how to do it. I just hope you\u2019ll think about it now, that\u2019s what I\u2019m asking. Do things in a way they matter and think about how they matter. Do what you can, no less, no more. We\u2019re enough people in the world to make the society change . There are a lot of concrete ways to contribute more and consume less, even without being a specialist. Most of all, think about what you\u2019re doing and how you can do it in a way that matters . Be political. Make choices . Don\u2019t let the system make your choices before you do. Everything you do deserves that you ask yourself: \u201cHow can I do this or that in a better way? Is there an alternative to consuming this product or this service?\u201d. Be uncompromising if you know what you\u2019re doing will make things better. Every little detail is important , there\u2019s so much we\u2019re fighting for, there\u2019s so much we\u2019re losing, we cannot make compromises. Don\u2019t wait for someone to sell you what you need, try and build it whenever you can . And most of all, share it when it\u2019s done. Don\u2019t do things just for yourself . There\u2019s surely someone else who has the same needs than you. Ask yourself: how can I share with those people, even if they don\u2019t have money. Learn . To be able to develop Duik, I had to learn coding. I did not know anything about computer science before I tried to develop my own tools, I did not learn this at school. Each and every little thing you learn is a political gesture too. The more you learn, the more impact you can have. Teach . Help others learn. It\u2019s easier when you\u2019re not alone, and I learned much more by teaching than when I was at school . Use your language, maybe you can translate things to make them available to more people (maybe you can translate this article?). You\u2019re a user, maybe you can provide some constructive feedback , not based on what you want and need, but thinking about what the community may need based on your experience. Contribute financially to projects which matter (which have an impact, which pull the community in the direction you think is right, not only because of what they do, but more importantly because of how they do it). Be an example , spread the word, convince people, share this article, exactly like what I am doing right now. Every public thing is political and deserves to be discussed.

Every little detail is important , there\u2019s so much we\u2019re fighting for, there\u2019s so much we\u2019re losing, we cannot make compromises. Don\u2019t wait for someone to sell you what you need, try and build it whenever you can . And most of all, share it when it\u2019s done. Don\u2019t do things just for yourself . There\u2019s surely someone else who has the same needs than you. Ask yourself: how can I share with those people, even if they don\u2019t have money. Learn . To be able to develop Duik, I had to learn coding. I did not know anything about computer science before I tried to develop my own tools, I did not learn this at school. Each and every little thing you learn is a political gesture too. The more you learn, the more impact you can have. Teach . Help others learn. It\u2019s easier when you\u2019re not alone, and I learned much more by teaching than when I was at school . Use your language, maybe you can translate things to make them available to more people (maybe you can translate this article?). You\u2019re a user, maybe you can provide some constructive feedback , not based on what you want and need, but thinking about what the community may need based on your experience. Contribute financially to projects which matter (which have an impact, which pull the community in the direction you think is right, not only because of what they do, but more importantly because of how they do it). Be an example , spread the word, convince people, share this article, exactly like what I am doing right now. Every public thing is political and deserves to be discussed. Be annoying, be angry, be upset .","title":"Consume less and contribute more"},{"location":"getting-started/be-annoying.html#help-duik","text":"Subscribe to the RxLab. membership 2 and benefit from nice perks like an early access to the tools.

This means all it does is automating things. It does nothing you could not do manually by yourself in After Effects (if you had time to do some very tedious work). This has two important meanings: A project rigged or animated with Duik can be opened with any instance of After Effects even if Duik is not installed. Duik uses only tools and techniques already existing in After Effects . Principles, User Interface and User Experience The goal of a tool like Duik is to make the life of animators and riggers easier. The priority was to make Duik as easy to learn as possible , while keeping it very quick to use . The other important goal was to make the interface as small as possible, so it won\u2019t take much space in the After Effects interface; we think it\u2019s very important to be able to focus on the timeline and the viewport of the application, without any other tools distracting you when you\u2019re animating. To achieve this, we\u2019ve made Duik smarter. Almost all tools can be used in a single click , without any prior configuration steps, letting Duik make the best choice depending on what you\u2019re doing, what are the selected layers, etc. Most of the character rigging process can be reduced to two clicks in Duik \u00c1ngela ! First click: create some Armatures and bones . Second click: Auto-rig the whole Armature . If you feel this is not enough, a nice procedural walk and run cycle is just another click away\u2026 User Interface (UI) As any modern script in After Effects , Duik has the form of a panel which can be docked with other native After Effects panels and third party tools (provided it was correctly installed and launched from the Window menu of After Effects ). The User Interface has been designed with these main ideas in mind: Keep it close to the form of the user interface of After Effects Using controls similar to the native controls of After Effects helps the user get started quickier. But it was not possible, for specific features and for performance and stability reasons, to make everything exactly the same as in After Effects and controls differ a bit. The idea is that Duik must not stand out too much when docked with other After Effects panels. Do not use windows and dialogs With very rare exceptions, everything Duik needs to display will be displayed in its main panel, it won\u2019t use dialogs and other windows, so you know where to find information, and you\u2019re not distracted by pop-ups. Also, there are no blocking windows (what\u2019s called Modal Dialogs ), to keep an agile workflow. Keep the UI as small as possible What is important when working with graphics is the viewport. Duik is as small as it can be so it won\u2019t interfere with your workspace. Duik welcomes you with this home panel, from where you can quickly access all the features. The top bar shows the main categories (read below). The central panel is used to display the tools, knobs and buttons of the tools, and the bottom bar includes secondary options and features. Tip This home screen can be de-activated to get to the latest used panel as soon as Duik is launched, but this greatly increases its launch time. Categorization Duik is a comprehensive tool set for rigging and animation. This means there are a lot of tools available, but they are categorized in some useful panels, depending on what you\u2019re doing (animating, rigging, using cameras,etc.) These categories are always available on the top bar. Each panel can be displayed by clicking on one of these top buttons. Bones Links and constraints Controllers Automation & expressions Animation Camera Tools Command Line and Feature Library The button on the right hand side opens a simple note editor . On the bottom bar, you\u2019ll find some other useful buttons: The progress bar (here in purple) shows how much money we got in donations for the current month.

Bug report and feature request : click this button to let us know what\u2019s on your mind. Settings Translate Duik : opens the website where you can contribute to the translation of Duik 3 . Help : opens the online help (this documentation you\u2019re reading), kept up-to-date. Individual panels As Duik is made of a lot of panels and sub-panels, depending on your workflow, sometimes you may lose time constantly switching from one panel to another, or just finding a tool you\u2019re not used to. As there are as many workflows as users, to address this issue Duik now comes with a lot of optional, individual and dockable panels , which you can use as stand-alone scripts. This is a great way to organize your workspace and keep several different panels of Duik opened at once. When these stand-alone panels are installed, you can also quickly open them by [Alt] + [Click] on the tab buttons in the Duik \u00c1ngela main panel. Tip Don\u2019t forget the stacked mode for After Effects panels, which can be nice to keep all your Duik panels at hand. Warning The more you open different script panels, the more memory leaks from After Effects. This can lead to very poor performance of the user interface of After Effects and of all script panels. Until this issue has been fixed by Adobe, try to limit the number of script panels you open during a working session, and/or restart After Effects regularly 4 . User Experience (UX) For every feature in Duik, the goal is to have a consistent workflow, the fastest possible, the easiest possible. Most of the tools work this way: Select layers, properties or keyframes in the timeline of After Effects Click. Click on the button of the tool you need For some tools, a secondary panel is displayed to ask for some additional needed information Watch Duik work (Actually, you won\u2019t, as for performance reasons most of the work remains hidden from the user, sorry ;) ) To be able to work in a single click, the tools need to be smart enough to take some decisions depending on what you\u2019re doing. Of course, Duik does not want you to be or feel limited to what you can do. Although most of the tools work in a single click, some of them are accompanied with a small button. This means there are options you can change for the future use of the tool, which you can access by clicking on it. Duik can also be personalized through some settings so you can adapt it to your liking. If you need help about any of the tools, keep your mouse cursor above the corresponding button: very often more details are explained in the tooltip which is shown a couple of seconds later. As you can read in the tooltip, when options are available for a specific tool, you can also [Shift] + [Click] to access them. UI Modes The User Interface can be adapted depending on the level of the user, to make it easier to use for beginners, while quicker and smaller for the most advanced users. Rookie, Standard and Expert modes shown in different panels. This UI mode can be changed through the settings . What Duik does in After Effects The After Effects features mainly used by Duik are: Expressions and parenting Layer creation Custom (Pseudo) effects Expressions Every time Duik adds an expression to a property, the expression begins with a comment to let you know what the expression is and does 5 . Layers Although Duik uses existing layer types in After Effects (mostly shape layers and null objects), the layers it creates have a specific use and can be considered as new layer types. Layers created by Duik have a marker at their beginning, showing how Duik uses them (their \u201cDuik Type\u201d), and containing important data that Duik needs to work with. Do not remove these markers (but you can move them away, even before the beginning of the comp to hide them, if you find them annoying). These markers can also be used to store and show other useful information, like the location of the limb, or the groups 6 the layer is assigned to. Pseudo effects The pseudo effect used by the Wiggle tool. Duik uses a lot of pseudo effects. Pseudo-Effects are a hack to create nicer controls for expressions than the native After Effects \u201cExpression controls\u201d effects, but they do nothing more than controlling expressions too. It\u2019s a bit complicated to create them by hand in After Effects, but there are useful scripts which do this very easily like Pseudo Effect Maker 7 . Duik makes a great use of them to create nice user-friendly controls in the effects of the controllers. Always have a look in the Effects panel of After Effects when you rig or animate something with Duik! Removing Duik \u201ceffects\u201d When you need to remove something made by Duik, you have to understand that Duik did nothing more than creating layers, expressions and pseudo effects. Each time you need to remove something, you just have to remove the expressions and pseudo effects created by Duik, and maybe the layers too. This can sometimes be a bit tedious, but future versions of Duik will include tools to automate this process. Tip If you remove the pseudo effect first, the expressions will be in error.

It\u2019s also useful for professional compositors and more generally for all people having enough experience with After Effects. Although its goal is to ease the rigging and animation process and it comes with a lot of automated tools, it always lets you customize the way it works and gives you access to all low-level tools used within higher level features like auto-rigs. That means you can do anything you\u2019d like with Duik, as it is very comprehensive. You\u2019re not limited to the use of automatic processes and auto-rigs . Most of the tools are very similar to what you can find in any advanced rigged character animation software, mostly in 3D, like Blender , Maxon Cinema 4D or Autodesk Maya . A skilled 3D rigger will quickly learn how to use Duik. A beginner learning Duik will know also the basics of 3D rigging. Duik can be a good start to learn character rigging and animation, as 2D is a bit easier than 3D, before learning advanced 3D rigging in Blender , Maya or Cinema 4D . Duik is not meant to be quick to learn; it\u2019s meant to be efficient and quick for the people who know how to rig or animate a character. Unobtrusive, non-blocking and extensible Duik is just a tool set for After Effects. Everything Duik does could be done manually in After Effects, except much slower. This means a character rigged with Duik can still be animated with any instance of After Effects, even if Duik is not installed. This also means that if you have in-depth knowledge of After Effects, you can easily customize the way Duik works and adjust the effects and expressions it creates. Duik will never force you into a predefined workflow, it won\u2019t impose its way of doing things. More than that, Duik gives you the tools you need to extend or modify it. Lots of settings and options: each time there are different ways of doing things, Duik uses the most common or useful default option, but always expose a way to change it and lets you customize the tools. Easy-to-use but comprehensive application programming interface (API): Duik comes with a complete API to integrate it into your custom pipeline and build your own auto-rigs and tools. Open source: if you know how to code, you can customize Duik to your needs, or contribute to the development. The user interface of Duik is meant to be small and unobtrusive. It must let you focus on your job and be discreet. To achieve this goal, it\u2019s as small as possible while staying intuitive, user-friendly and quick to use. It\u2019s also meant to blend as much as possible into the User Interface of After Effects, instead of standing out. Should I use Duik? Rigging - no matter what software you use - is a complicated subject that requires advanced knowledge of both character animation, the software you are using to do the rigging, and, ideally a good undersanding of anatomy. Before using Duik to create and animate character rigs, you should master: General basics of animation , including character animation (body mechanics, acting, walk cycles, etc.), and basic anatomy. After Effects animation tools : keyframe types, interpolations, graph editor\u2026 After Effects rigging tools : parenting, the basics about expressions, the puppet tool if you plan to use it\u2026 Do NOT try to learn both After Effects and Duik together . For example, it is NOT a good idea to try to rig a character with a combination of Duik and the puppet tool if you do not perfectly understand how the puppet tool itself works.

The process can be summarized in just a few words: Create an armature Create bones Link artwork layers to the bones Create controls Auto-rig Tweak the controllers if you\u2019d like Add other constraints if needed For each of these steps, Duik helps you with a lot of automation, and the basic rig of a standard character should take no more than a few minutes. Then, you\u2019re ready to animate: Prepare the animation Add the rigged composition to your scene(s) Extract the controllers to animate Automate some parts of the animation Use Duik\u2019s Procedural animation tools to animate more easily and quickly Use the Animation panel to tweak your keyframes Armatures and bones Bones are layers you can add in your composition which will drive the animations, like the rig of a real puppet. The process is very simple: create or import your artwork in After Effects, add Bones and move them to the right spots (the joints of the limbs). Then you can rig those Bones and link the design layers to the corresponding Bone layers. This way, the rig you create is independant from the design. This means it\u2019s easier to adjust the design even after the rig has been made, or even to re-use the same rig with other designs. Also, this rigging process is easier to fix or change if you ever need to adjust it even when you\u2019re already in the animation process. Controllers Using the auto-rig, and a set of constraints, what you end with are Controllers to drive the animation. You animate the controllers, they drive the bones through the constraints, and voil\u00e0! Your character moves. Constraints The interaction between the Controllers and the Bones , and between the Bones themselves, happens through some Constraints . Some of them are the core tools of Duik since the first version, like IK which drive the bending of limbs, and the Pins which are used to control any spatial properties like puppet pins or the emitter of a particle effect, or any B\u00e9zier value like shapes or masks. There is also a whole set of constraints to automate even more movements and make the animator\u2019s life very easier: it\u2019s possible to animate parenting with the Parent Constraint , or to constrain a layer to a B\u00e9zier path, to attach a layer to other layers using weights, etc. Auto-rig Let\u2019s face it, most of the time you only need to rig standard animals, with legs, arms, spine, maybe a tail\u2026 All what differs are the hair, some props and cloth. The Auto-rig is a versatile tool to automate most of this process. It is able to recognize predefined bones created by Duik and rig them automatically. It handles all kinds of limbs and animals, even imaginary ones. All you have to do is to create the Bones, the Auto-rig will do the rest, adding constraints and controllers for a fully rigged character. All that will be remaining are specific cases (hair, props), and facial rigging which is not automated yet . Procedural animation As soon as your character is rigged, you can begin the animation, being helped by a lot of Automations . These Automations are procedural animations and dynamics to quickly set up the most common animations and then focus on the characterization of your character. You can automate wiggles, springs, wheels, etc. with customizable and advanced controls for example to loop the effects, and access each and every detail quickly and easily. The Kleaner helps you quickly and semia-automagically apply the most important animation principles: anticipation, spacing, follow-through and overlapping animation.","title":"Rigging with Duik"},{"location":"guide/rigging.html#the-rigging-process-in-duik-angela","text":"To make the rigging process easier and more versatile in After Effects, Duik uses Bones , much like any 3D software.

Not only the NLA can edit your animations together, but it also can actually transition between animations as simply as a crossfade effect, by animating simple opacity values. Usage To use the NLA , you need to start from a base composition, containing what you wish to animate, which can be anything: simple layers, rigged character, props, using or not using Duik Controllers . Creation Like other tools in Duik, you first have to select what you\u2019re rigging/animating and then click on the Non-linear Animation button. Depending on the selection, this is how Duik will create and rig the NLA using the active composition: If Duik finds any selected properties , it will rig them, and only them. Else, if Duik finds any selected layers , it will rig all transform properties (position, rotation, scale, opacity) of these layers, plus the effects if the layer is a Duik Controllers . Else, Duik will rig all transform propeties and effects of all Duik Controllers , if any. Finally, if Duik did not find anything else, it will rig all transform properties of all layers . Note The current values (e.g. the current pose of the character) will be the \u201cneutral\u201d values, the \u201crest\u201d pose. They are the values from which the animation will be generated, and to which the NLA will fall back if there\u2019s no animation. Duik then creates a few NLA Compositions . By default, without selection, the NLA rigs all transform properties of the Duik controller layers. From a single base composition: the NLA creates a folder containing four new compositions: These compositions are: NLA.Clip:: name : Clips are the compositions containing the actual animated clips; they\u2019re where you animate the layers, using either keyframes or expressions. There can be as many NLA.Clip compositions as you need. You can quickly create new clips from the NLA options in the Duik Animation panel. NLA.Edit:: name : Edit** is the composition where you can edit your animated clips together. NLA.Original:: name is a copy of the original composition. It is used to create new clips. NLA.Render:: name is the composition containing the result of the edit, i.e. the clips edited together with their transitions. It is the composition which may be rendered or used as a precompositions in other parts of the project. Warning Do not change the first part of the name of these compositions (before and including :: ) as it is used by Duik and the NLA expressions to identify these compositions. The rest, the end of the name, can be safely modified at any time. Animated clips ( NLA.Clip:: ) The actual animations are made in the NLA.Clip:: compositions. Open these compositions and animate your layers as you would in any other composition. You can use either keyframes, expressions or any Duik feature, the NLA will work with all animated values no matter how they\u2019re controlled. To create new clips , you can either duplicate an existing clip (to work from the existing animation) or use the Add new clip button in the NLA options in the Duik Animation panel. This button will create a new clip for the NLA corresponding to the active composition (it doesn\u2019t matter which one it is as long as it belongs the the NLA , i.e. its name starts with \u201c NLA. \u201d). You can - and it is recommended to - change the duration of the \u201c NLA.Clip:: \u201d compositions, so they fit the exact duration of the animation. Edit clips together To edit the clips together and benefit from the powerful NLA features, open the NLA.Edit:: composition. From this comp, you can edit the clips together as you would with video clips in a video editing software. You can trim , move , duplicate the clips. To work with the edit: The NLA.Clip:: precompositions must be hidden. They\u2019re used by the NLA to generate the animation, but they\u2019re not actually used for rendering. The result is rendered in the NLA.Render:: composition. That\u2019s the reason why you should keep it enabled as the first layer of the NLA.Edit:: composition; this is the way to see the result of the edit, in real time. At times when there are no clips in the timeline (or if all their opacity is at 0 % ), the NLA falls back to the original values as they were before the creation of the NLA . Adding other properties to the NLA According to the way you\u2019ve setup the NLA , you may want to add other properties to be animated and rigged by the NLA . There are two simple ways to do that: First, open the NLA.Render:: composition. Then, you can either: Copy and paste the NLA expression from any property to the property you wish to add. Or select the new properties, and click on the Non-Linear animation button in the Animation Panel of Duik. Looping animation and time remapping You can use and modify the time remap property of the NLA.Clip:: precompositions in the NLA.Edit:: composition. This is a nice and easy way to change the speed of the animation, or to loop them, either using time remap keyframes, expressions or the Duik Looper feature. Transition between animation Animations can be controlled using the opacity of the the NLA.Clip:: precompositions. 100 % plays the animation as it is, 0 % deactivates it, and values in between multiply the values, effectively weighting the animations. This can especially be used to animate transitions between clips , for example to transition between a standing pose and a walk cycle, and then from a walk cycle to a run cycle. This works exactly as if you were animating a crossfade between video clips, except that the NLA doesn\u2019t actually animates the opacity but really animates the transition of all animated properties between the animated clips. Tip An NLA::Weight slider is also added in the effects of the NLA.Clip:: precompositions, which controls the weight the same way as the opacity of the layer, except that it\u2019s not limited to the range [0 %, 100 %] . You can use this slider instead of the opacity if you wish to extrapolate the animation. Use or render the result You can use either the NLA.Edit:: or the NLA.Render:: compositions to include the edited animation inside other compositions or to render it.","title":"Non-Linear Animation"},{"location":"guide/animation/nla.html#non-linear-animation","text":"Using the Non-Linear Animation tool, abreviated as NLA , you can edit animation clips the same way you would edit video clips in a non-linear editing sotware ( NLE ) like Adobe Premiere or Avid Media Composer for example, but right into After Effects , keeping all your animation editable at any time.

Depending on the selection, this is how Duik will create and rig the NLA using the active composition: If Duik finds any selected properties , it will rig them, and only them. Else, if Duik finds any selected layers , it will rig all transform properties (position, rotation, scale, opacity) of these layers, plus the effects if the layer is a Duik Controllers . Else, Duik will rig all transform propeties and effects of all Duik Controllers , if any. Finally, if Duik did not find anything else, it will rig all transform properties of all layers . Note The current values (e.g. the current pose of the character) will be the \u201cneutral\u201d values, the \u201crest\u201d pose. They are the values from which the animation will be generated, and to which the NLA will fall back if there\u2019s no animation. Duik then creates a few NLA Compositions . By default, without selection, the NLA rigs all transform properties of the Duik controller layers. From a single base composition: the NLA creates a folder containing four new compositions: These compositions are: NLA.Clip:: name : Clips are the compositions containing the actual animated clips; they\u2019re where you animate the layers, using either keyframes or expressions. There can be as many NLA.Clip compositions as you need. You can quickly create new clips from the NLA options in the Duik Animation panel. NLA.Edit:: name : Edit** is the composition where you can edit your animated clips together. NLA.Original:: name is a copy of the original composition. It is used to create new clips. NLA.Render:: name is the composition containing the result of the edit, i.e. the clips edited together with their transitions. It is the composition which may be rendered or used as a precompositions in other parts of the project.

Armatures for all types of animals As there are many different types of animals, these limbs are sorted in categories. Tetrapod legs Hominoids Type Description Examples Notes Hominoid 1 Human-like tetrapods 2 : biped humans and apes without tails Human, Chimpanzee, Gorilla\u2026 Humans and their equals Plantigrade Tetrapods which put the whole foot on the ground, with the heel touching the ground when they walk.

Horses, cattle, girafes, pigs, deers, camels, hippopotamuses\u2026 Food for humans. Arthropod Invertebrates which have more joints than tetrapods in their legs. Spiders, scorpions, ants, crabs, bees\u2026 Enemies of humans. Bird Flying digitigrades. Sparrows and pigeons but not chickens. Fish Swimming with fins. Note that Duik considers whales to be fishes too. The important thing is the way the animals move, not their actual classification. Fishes, sharks and whales. When using the auto-rig later, Duik will adjust the controls for each limb of each type of animal, to allow for the most detailed and easiest animation according to the animal you\u2019re animating. Read the next section for a complete description of the controls for each limb. In these categories, for each limbs you can asjust some options before the creation, to adapt them to your design, which makes the armatures and the auto-rig extremely versatile in Duik. The choices you can make in these options depends on the design of your character, and especially which joints are available and where they are located. To learn how each kind of limb may be designed and how the corresponding bones have to be located, read the Bones / Auto-rig section. Create armatures and bones There are several ways to create armatures with Duik, depending on what you need. As all the other tools in Duik \u00c1ngela, the bone creation tools try to be smart, and change their behavior depending on the context (i.e. the current selection in the current composition). You can create either complete characters (e.g. Humans, rabbits, etc.) using the OCO meta-rig panel 3 , single limbs (e.g. arms, legs, etc.), or custom armatures. Except for complete characters, the way the bones are created will change depending on the selection. Complete characters (meta-rigs) are always built in the center of the composition, and nothing is linked to the new armature, you\u2019ll have to create the links between the artwork and the armature by yourself later. Tip Click the Bone Settings button in the toolbar of the Bones panel to access some settings, where you can change how bones are created. Read the Bones and Auto-rig / Tools / Settings section for more information about these settings. Without selection Without any selection in the composition, predefined limbs and custom armatures will be created in the center of the composition. There is a very quick way to locate the new bones where you need them though: With the pen tool, [G] , and without any layer selected, click on the location of the bones you wish to create, from the root to the tip of the limb. This will create a new shape layer with a path, each vertex of the path located at a joint of the limb. Keeping this new path selected (do not change the current tool nor click anywhere else), create the new armature with Duik. Duik will automatically locate the new bones on the vertices of the path, and then remove this temporary shape layer, used only as a reference. 1. 2. 3. With a selection With a selection, they will be moved to the selected properties or layers, and if you [Ctrl] + [Click] on the creation button, these selected properties or layers will be automatically parented to the newly created armature. If B\u00e9zier path properties (i.e. mask path or shape path) are selected, one armature will be created for each path , with one bone for each vertex of the path. Vertex and tangents will both be linked to the corresponding bone, but there is no individual control for tangents. You can create them later if you need with the Pins 4 tool. If puppet pins are selected, one armature will be created for each layer , with one bone for each puppet pin. The order of the bones depends on the order of the pins in the layer stack. You can re-order them before creating the armature to adjust how the armature is created and optionally how the pin is linked to it. If layers are selected, without any other property, one armature will be created . Each bone will be moved to the corresponding layer, and the layer can optionally be parented to it. Note If there are selected layers with their anchor points at the same location in the composition, the armature will not use the layers\u2019 position, and layers will not be parented, to avoid weird issues happening when layers share the same anchor point in the same armature. Warning Never duplicate nor copy and paste bones in After Effects, always create new armatures or use the Duplicate button in the bones panel of Duik. Internal unique identifiers are associated with the armatures, which won\u2019t be updated when you copy or duplicate the armatures in After Effects.

This makes it the cornerstone of the rigging process in Duik, which can be summarized to: Create Bones Auto-rig Animate As a smart tool, it will guess what you are trying to do, depending on the layers you have selected. It is able to add some \u201csimple\u201d IK or to rig a complete character in a single click. Note The Auto-rig is a tool in constant evolution. In each future version of Duik, it is going to work better and better, handling more different situations. Using the Auto-rig Select some layers in the composition Click the Auto-rig button. If there are bones in the selection: If there are predefined armatures (arm, leg, spine, tail\u2026), the Auto-rig will rig everything for you so you can start to animate rught afterwards. If the bones are custom armatures, the Auto-rig will add IK 1 to rig them, determining which type of IK would be best according to the number and location of the layers, and the auto-rig settings. If there are Controller layers in the selection: The Auto-rig will use them when possible, depending on their location, instead of creating new controllers. This is an easy way to use your own cuystom controllers (you just have to make sure they\u2019re tagged ). 2 If the selection is made only of standard layers , the Auto-rig will add IK to rig them, trying to guess how they need to be rigged using their parenting and the location of their anchor points. If the layers are not parented yet, the Auto-rig is able to parent them automatically, but it\u2019s better in this case to select the layers in the right order: from the tip to the root of the limb (from hand to shoulder, or from foot to hip\u2026). Controllers As opposed to previous versions of Duik, the Auto-rig in Duik Bassel is able to create any needed controllers to rig the selected layers. You do not necessarily have to create them yourself first. This being said, if you need or want to add and use a specific controller, you just have to include it in the layer selection before running the Auto-rig. It will automatically detect and use it. This is especially useful if, for example, you want to control two different IKs with the same controller. Tip Always have a look in the effects of the Controllers after having run the Auto-rig! Depending on what has been rigged, there may be a lot of options there. Auto-rig options When rigging less than three layers, the auto-rig always know what to do, as it is able to create controllers to animate both using FK and IK at the same time, but with more layers, you can set the preferred behavior in the auto-rig options. With three bones you can use one of these methods: 1+2-layer IK creates a single-layer IK on the root, and a two-layer IK on the remaining two parts of the limb. Both are controlled with the same controller. This is the default way of rigging arthropod legs for example. 2+1-layer IK creates a two-layer IK on the first two parts of the limb, and a single-layer IK to control the last part. Both are controlled with the same controller. FK creates an FK controller, which has automatic overlapping animation options. B\u00e9zier IK is a kind of IK controlled by B\u00e9zier functions, similar to B\u00e9zier paths in After Effects; this is espacially useful for tails or spines for example, when you want to achieve a smooth curve. B\u00e9zier FK combines a B\u00e9zier IK with FK controls, to be able to animate the IK use the rotation properties of the controllers at each end. You can also set your preference for longer chains, made of more than three bones. In this case, the choice is limited to: FK , B\u00e9zier IK , B\u00e9zier FK . If you check the Create a root controller box , the Auto-rig will add a root, master controller which can be used to translate and rotate the whole rig at once. Use the baking options to automatically bake 3 the bones before rigging them; this is important to improve the performance of the rig. It will \u201cfreeze\u201d the bones as they are at the moment you rig them, as you should not need to change their appearance anymore. All types of animals and limbs Duik can create armatures for almost all type of animals and limbs, and the auto-rig can rig them automatically. Although the type of limbs are sorted into categories corresponding to different types of animals, you can combine arbitrarilly limbs from different categories. You could see these categories as different ways to rig and control the limbs, according to the way your character moves. This way you can create and rig any kind of character, from hybrids to robots. Arms and legs Spines Tails and hair Wings Fins Tip You can use the OCO meta-rigs 4 as examples of how you can combine limbs to create complete animals. cf. Constraints / Kinematics . \u21a9 cf.

For all these legs, Duik creates a control at the end (on the foot or hand), and depending on the bones available in the armature (thus depending on how you\u2019ve designed the limb) 1 , some controls for specific joints of the limb are available in the effects of the controller layer. Front legs Back legs Note All tetrapods (four-legged animals) have the same joints on the legs, and although they may seem to be reversed, it\u2019s never actually the case. For example, it may seem that the knee is reversed on wading birds compared to mammals, but the joint we see as the knee is actually the ankle, the knee being hidden higher under the feathers. When rigging legs, Duik creates a single controller with all the detailed controls in its effects. For all legs, there is at least one IK Effect which controls the main part of the limb, and according to the type of animal, the available bones in the limbs, or what was selected when running the auto-rig, there may be other effects to control other joints of the limb. Read the Constraints / Kinematics section for more details about the IK and FK effects. Hominoids and plantigrades A typical plantigrade leg, with all possible joints and bones A typical human arm, shoulder not included A typical plantigrade (bear) front leg, shoulder not included Additionally to the IK controlling the thigh and calf, or arm and forearm parts of the limb, the following effects may be available. Foot roll The foot roll effect is available only if the leg is a standard leg made of two parts (a thigh and a calf). Use this effect to control all possible rotations of the foot, using different anchor points: The Toes angle simply rotates the toes (or claws). The Tipetoe angle rotates the foot from its tip, its very end, like a dancer tiptoeing. The Heel angle rotates the foot from the point of contact between the heel and the ground. The Foot roll angle is a very useful control when animating a walk for example. Negative values rotate the foot the same way as the Heel value, and positive values raise the heel by rotating it around the toe joint, which happens at the end of each step during the walk, when the foot is behind the character, just before it raises to go forward again. Note Some of these controls have a slightly different effect if the toes aren\u2019t separated from the foot, if there\u2019s no joint between the foot and the toes. As all these values rotate (part of) the foot using different pivots, they should never be used at the same time. When one of these values is set, the three other values should always be 0 \u00b0 (the foot can\u2019t rotate using multiple pivots at the same time). Note Rotate the controller itself to rotate the foot from the ankle. Different ways to rotate the foot: Rest pose, Foot rotation (using the controller), Toe angle, Tiptoe angle, Heel angle, and Foot Roll angle. Notice how the three last angles also move the knee. For a precise control of the foot, make sure each joints and bones are perfectly located, especially the toe bone, the tip, and the heel, as shown on the picture above. Tip The Tiptoe , Heel , and Foot roll values all move the knee when they\u2019re animated, and make it difficult to control precisely the movement of the knee and the leg. You should avoid animating them when possible. Shoulder controls The two shoulder effects are available if the limb is an arm or front leg, and a shoulder bone has been included. The IK effect controls the rotation of the shoulder; an automatic rotation occurs when the hand moves, according to the Weight value of this effect. Use the FK value to manually adjust or animate the rotation of the shoulder. The Shoulder position effect controls the position of the shoulder. An automatic translation of the shoulder can be controlled with the Auto effect, but be aware that this movement happens if and only if there\u2019s an actual animation (with keyframes or expressions), and not when just manipulating the controller. Use the Position value to manually adjust or animate the position of the shoulder. Digitigrades A typical digitigrade (cat) back leg Additionally to the IK controlling the thigh and calf, or arm and forearm parts of the limb, the following effects may be available. Foot roll The foot roll effect is available only if the leg is a standard leg made of two parts (a thigh and a calf, or an arm and a forearm) and the toes/claws are separated from the foot (i.e. the toe joint can be rotated). Use this effect to control all possible rotations of the foot, using different anchor points: The Tipetoe angle rotates the foot from its tip, its very end, like a dancer tiptoeing. The Claws angle rotates the fingers or claws. The Foot roll angle is a very useful control when animating a walk for example. It rotates the foot around the fingers/claws joint. As the Tiptoe and Foot roll values rotate (part of) the foot using different pivots, they should never be used at the same time. When one of these values is set, the other value should always be 0 \u00b0 (the foot can\u2019t rotate using multiple pivots at the same time). Note To the contrrary of plantigrades, the rotation of the controller itself, which rotates the whole foot around the toe joint, may not be very useful in this rig. For a precise control of the foot, make sure each joints and bones are perfectly located, especially the toe bone and the tip, as shown on the picture above. Tip The Tiptoe and Foot roll values both move the knee when they\u2019re animated, and make it difficult to control precisely the movement of the knee and the leg.

An automatic translation of the shoulder can be controlled with the Auto effect, but be aware that this movement happens if and only if there\u2019s an actual animation (with keyframes or expressions), and not when just manipulating the controller. Use the Position value to manually adjust or animate the position of the shoulder. Ungulate A typical ungulate (horse) front leg, shoulder not included Additionally to the IK controlling the thigh and calf, or arm and forearm parts of the limb, the following effects may be available. IK | Foot This single-layer IK controls the orientation of the whole foot (including the hoof). Hoof This simple angle controls the rotation of the hoof. It is to be used when the leg is not standing and in contact with the ground. The rotation of the controller itself rotate the foot around the hoof joint, a bit like what the Foot Roll values do with the plantigrade and digitigrade rigs. Shoulder controls The two shoulder effects are available if the limb is an arm or front leg, and a shoulder bone has been included. The IK effect controls the rotation of the shoulder; an automatic rotation occurs when the hand moves, according to the Weight value of this effect. Use the FK value to manually adjust or animate the rotation of the shoulder. The Shoulder position effect controls the position of the shoulder.

Use the Position value to manually adjust or animate the position of the shoulder. Arthropod The arthropod rig, in the current version of Duik, is actually similar to the ungulate rig, and has the same controls and effects. Only the initial locations of the joints and length ratios of the different parts of the limbs differ. cf.

In most cases, it is easier to have rigs (for characters or other items) in their own precompositions, but this is not the most handy way to animate, especially when you have several characters in the same shot or if you need to see the background. To avoid assembling all the rigs and the background in the same composition, you can keep the rigs in a precomposition and Extract the controllers. This way, all the controllers are available in the same main composition, with the background if you wish, but the rigs stay precomposed. This is especially useful when there are a lot of layers for the rigs, and if you want to render proxies for character animations in order to improve performance when compositing the shot. All controllers are parented to the precomposition, which makes it easy to move the rig; the precomposition can even be rotated and scaled too. Note You can flip the character with a negative scale value on the horizontal axis. Usage Select the precomposition. Click the Extract button in the Controllers panel . Hint All layers tagged as controllers will be extracted: you can tag your own layers to extract them along with the controllers actually created by Duik. Options You can choose to extract controllers using expressions or Essential Properties . With expressions , the performance is much better , but the precomposed rig can\u2019t be re-used in another composition. You must keep a clean copy of the rig to be able to duplicate it each time you need to animate in a new composition and extract the controllers. With essential properties , there\u2019s no need to keep a copy of the rigged composition: the same composition can be used as many times as you need in the same project, but the performance is worse, and may even be extremely slow. By default, Duik will bake the controllers before extracting them, to improve the performance of the rig during the animation process. This way you can keep the controllers editable in a backup copy of the rigged precomposition, to be able to edit the rig later, but automatically have the best performance when animating after the controller extraction. Recommended workflow To keep the best performance possible, it\u2019s better to always extract controllers using expressions, except in specific cases when there are very few controllers to extract. The more essential properties are created, the worse the performance is. You should always keep your rigs in their own After Effects project files, and then import them in the projects where you\u2019re animating. As soon as you import a specific rig, you should rename its main composition and all precompositions it uses; this is the best way to make sure all composition names are unique and avoid expression errors if you need to import several times the same rig in the same After Effects projet. Making sure that composition names are unique and that you always keep a copy of your rigs in their own projects allows you to easily and safely extract controllers using expressions. This way you won\u2019t need to use essential properties, as you could always import the rig as many times as you need it. Replacing an already extracted precomposition This is the process to follow if you need to update a rig and replace a precomposition which controllers have already been extracted.

With the support of OCO, Duik now also includes a lot of Meta-rigs, predefined armatures you can use to rig an entire character in a few clicks, thanks to the almighty Duik Auto-rig . The Meta-rig Library The OCO Panel in Duik is a library of meta-rigs , to help you create armatures for all kind of animals in a single click. These meta-rigs are sorted into categories, corresponding to the type of animals. Each of these meta-rigs has been carefully crafted so that their limbs have realistic proportions and the joints have an optimal location for 2D cut-out animation. That means they can be used both for rigging existing characters or as a reference to design new characters. As they follow the OCO standard, the Duik Auto-rig is able to rig the armatures created using these meta-rigs in a single click and provide all needed controllers for a very easy, though very detailed animation. Creating new armatures To create an armature from an OCO meta-rig, you just have to find it in the library and double click the item or click the apply button. You can filter categories and meta-rigs using the search field on top of the panel. To automatically assign a given name to the new character, you can set its name in the character name field on top of the panel, this name will be used for the creation of the armature. Note The created armatures are using Duik Bones , and all of the bone options and features are available to further customize it 1 . Creation options If you [Shift] + [Click] the apply button, you can set a few options for the creation of the bones. You can change the type of bones to be created: Full Bones are bones with envelops and noodles 1 , if you plan to use all of these bone features. Light Bones are simpler bones with better performance, but without envelops nor noodles or other advanced features. You can show the bone envelops by default. Use this if you\u2019re using the meta-rig as a reference to design a character for example. You can show the bone noodles by default. You can use this to use the meta-rig as a base for designing a simple vector character. Select the Create new composition option to create the new armature in its own dedicated composition. Extending the library You can add your own custom OCO meta-rigs to the library, from any composition containing Duik Bones. You can handle the content of the library with the buttons on the bottom right corner of the panel. Duik will collect all information from the bones in the current composition and export it as a new OCO file stored in the library for future use. When creating the meta-rig, you can include an icon which should be a small PNG file. Set the approximative character height (from its lowest bone to the highest) so that information can be used when creating multiple characters in the same scene and automatically have them approximately at the right size. This height is in centimeters to be independant from the resolution. OCO Files The library is actually just a folder structure containing OCO files, which is by default located in your Documents folder. You can quickly open this folder with the folder button, or set a new folder to be used as the library with [Alt] + [Click] . In this case you must select (or create) an new OCO.config file which will contain all your OCO settings, shared accross all applications using OCO and this same config file.

Added new controls and interpolation options for the Swink when it is used on colors. Added color options for the Interpolator. You can now select a better colorspace to use during the interpolation, to have better (brightest) colors in between keyframes. Added the ability to add lists to color properties Performance improvements and options were also added. Added new \u201cLight Bones\u201d ; they can be activated in the bone settings panel or OCO Create Metarig options. Added optional raster (PNG) controllers ; this improves a lot the performance compared to shape layers. The option can be set in the settings panel of the controllers. The bone settings panel can now edit the bone color and opacity even if they\u2019re already baked. The Bake Expression tool has been slightly improved to generate keyframe interpolations closer to the original one in specific cases. This is part of an ongoing work on all keyframe and timeline stuff. Stay in touch! And this version also has introduces many other improvements to make your life easier. Added an Extrapolation weight, a % you can animate to adjust the extrapolation (e.g. start and stop a loopout/in cycle) on the Looper/Interpolator. Added an option to not lock the scale of null controllers by default (so you can use them to quickly scale several layers at once). Added an option to automatically create a root controller in the autorig. Added opacity controls to the pins. Refactored the pin settings panel, which is now similar to other settings panels. Allow negative anticipation in the Kleaner (to simulate some kind of rusty thing, or hesitation when starting a movement) Alt Click the List button to automatically add a keyframe to the second slot (and quickly reveal it with \u2018U\u2019 in the timeline) OCO Update: OCO now uses an \u201cOCO.config\u201d files to share settings and the OCO Library between all applications using OCO, a bit like OpenColorIO config files. OCO is still under heavy development, and many new features will be added in the next months, both in After Effects, Blender and Krita. The \u2018Bug report\u2019 button now redirects to a new and better form on rxlaboratory.org, pre-filled with details about your system. Finally, new OCO metarigs were included: Horse Bear Lemur Tyrannosaurus Scorpion Whale Monkey \u25ba The list of all bug fixes is available here . 17.0 New Features (Auto-)Rigging Note There have been some changes in the way tools are named in Duik \u00c1ngela, compared to Duik Bassel. \u2022 Structures are now named Bones (single item) or Armatures (complete limbs). \u2022 Bones are now named Pins . This changelog and all the documentation now use these new naming. New Auto-rigs : Wings rigging is now a thing. Hair rigging is now a thing. Arthropod leg rigging is now a thing. Fish (fins and spine) rigging is now a thing. New Bones : previously known as Structures, Bones have been redesigned, and new limbs for all kind of animals are available (fish and their fins, snakes, wings\u2026). Note: the bones from the previous versions of Duik are now named Pins . Bones now have optional envelops and noodles . Bone envelops are very useful to design limbs and make sure the joints work well, and combined with the bone noodles they\u2019re a quick way to create and animate customizable limbs in a single click and a few settings. New controller shapes: Vertebrae Rib cage / Torso The Link art button in the bone panel will (try to) automatically parent all artwork layers to their corresponding bones. Constraints The Connector has many new abilities: it can now use the audio from a layer to control properties. it has a new Layer list mode to quicklly connect a bunch of layers to a dropdown menu effect. its UI has been made simpler. New type of IK/FK: B\u00e9zier FK , which is used by the Auto-rig for spine and neck rigging. The Move anchor point tool can move the anchor points of the selected layers to their bounds or center. It works with pixel layers and shape layers, and can use the masks too. It can also take a custom margin into account. This tool is located both the the links & constraints panel and the animation panel. Key Morph : also known as Shape Keys , Pose Morph , Blend Shapes or Morphers in other software, they\u2019re now available in After Effects with Duik, and can be easily connected to nice controllers using the Connector . A property can be connected to a selection of key morphs using the Connector . Note that the master property must use keyframes (it can not be controlled by expressions). UI Tweaks: Kinematics Constraints button: quickly add IK and FK constraints to the layers. Parent Constraints are assembled under the same button group. Tranformation Constraints are assembled under the same button group. 2+1 layer IK is a new way to use IK on a 3-layer chain, which is useful for arthropods and the new way of rigging ungulates. Automation and expressions The Kleaner is back and it\u2019s been completely redesigned. It now uses general intuitive parameters to control the whole animation (like the size, weight, friction, etc.), but you still can fine-tune it with more detailed and advanced parameters. It is now able to correctly handle easing, anticipation and follow through on spatial properties without separating the dimensions. In this case, just use roving keyframes when the layer is moving, and keep linear keyframes when it stops. The Kleaner will precisely follow the trajectory while handling the speed. Ease is automatically computed for the motion to be as smooth as possible. If you want to stop at a specific keyframe, switch it to maintain . The overlap (and soft body simulation) has been improved a lot: the animation is better and smoother, and performance is a bit better. It now has (soft) limits too! The Walk Cycle is now also a Run Cycle . Its controls and performance have been greatly improved. The Swink tool replaces the previous Swing and Blink tools. It makes a property regularly switch between two values, with advanced options to manage the frequency and interpolation between the two. The frequency of the Swink can be animated. The Random automation can be used when a property needs to be completely randomized; e.g. when a Wiggle automation is too smooth. The Bake expressions tool is able to bake selected expressions or the whole project expressions to keyframes. It comes with two algorithms: a precise algorithm which adds a keyframe per frame (or less, according to the precision factor you can set), and a smart algorithm which automatically adds as less keyframes as possible, and the resulting keyframes are easy to edit. The Bake Composition tool bakes all expressions in the comp (or on selected layers), and removes all non-renderable layers (guide layers, nulls, etc.). If a renderable layer was parented to a non-renderable one, its transformation properties are baked to keyframes. Edit Expression in the Automation and Tools panel opens the selected expression in your favorite external editor to edit them more easily, then reloads them in the After Effects properties when you\u2019ve finished editing them. Expression tools : various useful tools to fix and work with expressions (in the automation panel toolbar). Animation New Non-linear Animation (NLA) tool replaces the previous Animation Blender tool. It is a great and very easy way to edit animations as you would do with video clips in a Non-linear video editor like Adobe Premiere . A Tweening section in the animation panel helps you tween your animation, if you\u2019re working with hold keyframes before going to curves for example (using the Kleaner or not). Includes three new tools: Tween Slider : adds a new in-between to the current time, according to a ratio between the previous and next pose. Split Keyframes : splits the selected keyframes into couples of keyframes with the same values (freezing the pose for a predefined time). Freeze pose : freezes the previous (or next) pose up to the current time (copies the previous or next keyframe to the current time). Sync Keyframes moves all selected keyframes to the current time. If multiple keyframes in the same property are selected, they\u2019re offset to the current time, keeping the animation. Snap Keyframes snaps the keyframes to actual frames if they\u2019re in between (like it happens when changing the duration of an animation or the framerate of a comp). The Sequencer distributes your layers or keyframes in time. New Interpolator tool (animation panel). The Interpolator is a tool to help you.... Interpolate keyframes. It\u2019s a bit like the Kleaner but on a low-level where you can really choose and tweak how the animation is interpolated, for more advanced users. It includens extrapolation methods to loop in or out, with different modes: constant, continue, ping pong, cycle, bounce, follow-through. When an extrapolation is animated, for example when stopping a loop, the property now stays at the right value. It is able to extrapolate motion (loops) in between keyframes if the property is still. Quickly save, export, import, apply animations with the new Animation library (animation panel). Tools DuCop (Duduf Comp Parameters) is now included in Duik (Tools/Composition panel). It enables you to change the composition settings of all selected compositions including their precompositions. It will also adjust the duration and size of any layer which should match the new composition duration and size if it\u2019s changed. Use Crop precompositions to\u2026 crop precompositions. The tool uses the mask(s) found on the precomposition layer to crop the source composition: just draw a quick mask on the layer then click on the button to crop the composition, without moving any of the layers using the same source composition. The Layer Manager will help (re)naming layers and setting useful tags for rigging and grouping layers. The Note panel can now also save composition-specific or project-specific notes. These notes are savec in the project file. The Script library helps you sort all your scripts. From there, you can easily access, edit, and launch your installed scripts and dockable panels, or any other stand-alone script. The Script editor is a basic script to let you edit and run simple scripts. But even if it\u2019s basic, it includes the whole Duik API to easily use Duik\u2019s advanced functions in a few simple lines. Miscellaneous New User Interface : Along with a complete code refactor, Duik underwent a complete UI redesign. Performance (loading time) has been improved, Duik now fits better in the interface of After Effects, it is more discreet and let you focus on your work. Complete code refactor : Duik is easier to maintain, code is better organizezd, performance has been improved\u2026 A progress bar is available at the bottom of the panel to show the current funding status\u2026 We\u2019ve finally dropped support of After Effects CS6 , sorry, it was too much work to keep compatibility for too few users. CS6 ( v11.0.2 ) dates back to October 2012, it\u2019s time to update! Duik should now work on all versions of After Effects starting with After Effects CC ( v12.0 , July 2013). Improvements (Auto-)Rigging Performance has been improved for almost all of the tools and expressions. Legs : The Foot Roll performance has been improved (a lot) with a simpler rig. Ungulate leg rigs have been changed to be closer to the actual anatomy of the animals you eat (cattle, cute lambs, horses\u2026) The Spine Auto-Rig has been tweaked to better handle some special cases and globally improve controls over the spine and the torso. Tails and all FK with overlap are now stretchy! Show/Hide bones and controllers : [Alt] + [Click] to show/hide only the unselected layers. IK/FK : The 3-layer IK has been removed from Duik as it wasn\u2019t used, and could easily be replaced by the better 2+1 or 1+2 IK. Added a Weight slider to the 2-layer and 3-layer IK to be able to progressively transition between IK and FK (this may be useful with the new Non-Linear Animation and Animation Library ). Removed Advanced / Full rotation limit option from the IK effects. One-layer IK now have optional limits, with a softness parameter. Two-layer IK sides can now be switched progressively, and an auto-swing option can automate reversing the joint. Bone and controller sizes are now responsive to the composition size (if the\u2019re not baked) Constraints The Connector can now connect both velocities or speed. Pins on shapes: added a \u201cLock tangent\u201d button in the effects of the vertex layers. The performance of the Parent Constraint has been greatly improved. Note that expressions in the weight properties may not work correctly, you may have to bake them to keyframes (for example using the new Bake expressions tool from Duik). Locators (used by Parent Across comps ) are now created at the bottom of the layer stack. Path Constraint : [Alt] + [Clic] to move the layer to the first point of the path. Lists can now be simply duplicated to get more tracks. Property Info now shows keyframe information. Automation and expressions Wiggle : The Wiggle can now optionally use a different seed for each controlled layer. The frequency of the Wiggle can now be animated. The initial random seed is better chosen. The Effector now also works with custom shapes ! (in addition to the circle and the line). The Randomizer now has the ability to generate random values distributed along a Gaussian bell-shaped function for a more natural result. The Motion Trail parameters have been improved, and it is now able to use the taper parameters from After Effects >= 17.1. The Wheel automation has a new Straight option for wheels moving along a non-horizontal straight line, which improves performance for this specific case compared to the Curved option. The Looper now uses the new Interpolator tool. Renamed Separate dimensions to Split values . Animation Copy animation : [Alt] + [Click] to cut the keyframes. The IK/FK Switch tool now works better with controllers which have a combination of 1-layer and 2-layer IK (like an arm and its shoulder). Cameras The 2D Multiplane Camera tool is now better organized, with a single camera controller on top of all levels. The Camera rig now includes advanced behaviours like the 2D Multiplane Camera already did. Both the Camera rig and the 2D Multiplane Camera now automatically handle motion interpolation for perfect and smooth camera movements. Tools You can now Search and Replace in effect names too. Miscellaneous Rename : when renaming puppet pins, just select a single layer to rename all puppet pins found on it, no need to select the pins individually anymore. Sanity tests : The Sanity tests have been improved to work more efficiently. The After Effects up time is now checked, as After Effects has memory leaks and needs to be restarted every few hours to keep the memory consumption and performance optimal. Improved performance. Some tests may be paused when the project is too big; they can still be run manually. Scriptify Expression tool now creates a variable according to the property name, converted to camelCase. Fixes Fixed glitching issues hapenning sometimes with IK when they\u2019re stretched. The Scale Z-Link now works correctly when the camera is locked. The Camera rig tool no longer fails with one-node cameras, but shows a user-friendly alert. Copy / Paste Animation and the Animation Library now handle text keyframes. Copy / Paste Animation now correctly selects missing layers. Edit Mode now works correctly with locked child layers. Controller extraction is now faster and more reliable on After Effects > 22.0. Pins now work better with 3D layers.","title":"Changelog"},{"location":"misc/changelog.html#duik-angela-17-changelog","text":"This is the list of what has changed since the previous major version of Duik ( Duik Bassel, 16.2 ). \u25ba The detailed list of changes of minor versions of Duik is available here .","title":"Duik \u00c1ngela (17) Changelog"},{"location":"misc/changelog.html#171","text":"This new version of Duik \u00c1ngela introduces important features to help color animation, which may be extended later into more features or tools in another dedicated tool set.

PREAMBLE The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other functional and useful document \u201cfree\u201d in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by others. This License is a kind of \u201ccopyleft\u201d, which means that derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free software. We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference. 1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work under the conditions stated herein. The \u201cDocument\u201d, below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as \u201cyou\u201d. You accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law. A \u201cModified Version\u201d of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another language. A \u201cSecondary Section\u201d is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document\u2019s overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them. The \u201cInvariant Sections\u201d are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none. The \u201cCover Texts\u201d are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words. A \u201cTransparent\u201d copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that is not \u201cTransparent\u201d is called \u201cOpaque\u201d. Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output purposes only. The \u201cTitle Page\u201d means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, \u201cTitle Page\u201d means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work\u2019s title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text. The \u201cpublisher\u201d means any person or entity that distributes copies of the Document to the public. A section \u201cEntitled XYZ\u201d means a named subunit of the Document whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as \u201cAcknowledgements\u201d, \u201cDedications\u201d, \u201cEndorsements\u201d, or \u201cHistory\u201d.) To \u201cPreserve the Title\u201d of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a section \u201cEntitled XYZ\u201d according to this definition. The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License. 2. VERBATIM COPYING You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3. You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly display copies. 3. COPYING IN QUANTITY If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document\u2019s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects. If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages. If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general network-using public has access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public. It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document. 4. MODIFICATIONS You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version: A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that version gives permission. B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you from this requirement. C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the publisher. D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document. E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices. F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below. G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document\u2019s license notice. H. Include an unaltered copy of this License. I. Preserve the section Entitled \u201cHistory\u201d, Preserve its Title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section Entitled \u201cHistory\u201d in the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence. J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on. These may be placed in the \u201cHistory\u201d section. You may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission. K. For any section Entitled \u201cAcknowledgements\u201d or \u201cDedications\u201d, Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein. L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles. M. Delete any section Entitled \u201cEndorsements\u201d. Such a section may not be included in the Modified Version. N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled \u201cEndorsements\u201d or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section. O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers. If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version\u2019s license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section titles. You may add a section Entitled \u201cEndorsements\u201d, provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties\u00e2\u20ac\u201dfor example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard. You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one. The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version. 5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers. The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work. In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled \u201cHistory\u201d in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled \u201cHistory\u201d; likewise combine any sections Entitled \u201cAcknowledgements\u201d, and any sections Entitled \u201cDedications\u201d. You must delete all sections Entitled \u201cEndorsements\u201d. 6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects. You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document. 7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an \u201caggregate\u201d if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation\u2019s users beyond what the individual works permit. When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document. If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire aggregate, the Document\u2019s Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate. 8. TRANSLATION Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this License, and all the license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include the original English version of this License and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the translation and the original version of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail. If a section in the Document is Entitled \u201cAcknowledgements\u201d, \u201cDedications\u201d, or \u201cHistory\u201d, the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual title. 9. TERMINATION You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation. Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice. Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does not give you any rights to use it. 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. See https://www.gnu.org/licenses/ . Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License \u201cor any later version\u201d applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this License can be used, that proxy\u2019s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Document. 11. RELICENSING \u201cMassive Multiauthor Collaboration Site\u201d (or \u201cMMC Site\u201d) means any World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works. A public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server. A \u201cMassive Multiauthor Collaboration\u201d (or \u201cMMC\u201d) contained in the site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC site. \u201cCC-BY-SA\u201d means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco, California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license published by that same organization. \u201cIncorporate\u201d means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or in part, as part of another Document. An MMC is \u201celigible for relicensing\u201d if it is licensed under this License, and if all works that were first published under this License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008. The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing. ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of the License in the document and put the following copyright and license notices just after the title page: Copyright (C) YEAR YOUR NAME. Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3 or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation; with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts. A copy of the license is included in the section entitled \"GNU Free Documentation License\". If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts, replace the \u201cwith \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Texts.\u201d line with this: with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST. If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the situation. If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit their use in free software.","title":"Documentation license"},{"location":"misc/doc-license.html#gnu-free-documentation-license","text":"Version 1.3, 3 November 2008 Copyright (C) 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc. https://fsf.org/ Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.","title":"GNU Free Documentation License"},{"location":"misc/doc-license.html#0-preamble","text":"The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other functional and useful document \u201cfree\u201d in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by others. This License is a kind of \u201ccopyleft\u201d, which means that derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free software. We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.

PREAMBLE"},{"location":"misc/doc-license.html#1-applicability-and-definitions","text":"This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work under the conditions stated herein. The \u201cDocument\u201d, below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as \u201cyou\u201d. You accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law. A \u201cModified Version\u201d of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another language. A \u201cSecondary Section\u201d is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document\u2019s overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them. The \u201cInvariant Sections\u201d are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none. The \u201cCover Texts\u201d are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words. A \u201cTransparent\u201d copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that is not \u201cTransparent\u201d is called \u201cOpaque\u201d. Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output purposes only. The \u201cTitle Page\u201d means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, \u201cTitle Page\u201d means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work\u2019s title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text. The \u201cpublisher\u201d means any person or entity that distributes copies of the Document to the public. A section \u201cEntitled XYZ\u201d means a named subunit of the Document whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as \u201cAcknowledgements\u201d, \u201cDedications\u201d, \u201cEndorsements\u201d, or \u201cHistory\u201d.) To \u201cPreserve the Title\u201d of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a section \u201cEntitled XYZ\u201d according to this definition. The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License.","title":"1.

Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects. If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages. If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general network-using public has access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.

In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version: A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document).

A single undo group is now created when using the Spring instead of several different groups. After Effects no longer freezes when trying to create Bones with just the Effects group selected. Wiggle expressions have been improved to fix potential bugs, especially when using the legacy engine. 16.2.28 Fixes Fixed overlap simulation of the Kleaner when used on a position property. Fixed an issue where the Kleaner used on a spatial property would skip a frame in the caluclation of the follow-through. Fixed Duik storing settings in a wrong folder if the default one has been changed. 16.2.27 Fixes The \u201cFix Unused comp\u201d blocking popup has been removed. Disabled the corresponding live-fix option in the Sanity Tests 16.2.26 Fixes Fixed a bug in the sanity tests initialization preventing Duik from correctly launching ( error at line 38454 ). 16.2.25 Improvements Added useful options to the Sanity checks , along with new quick ways to fix detected issues. Fixes Parenting across comps now takes the time offset of the precomposed layer into account. 16.2.24 Fixes Added an alert when Scale Z-Link is used without camera. Fixed the duplicatedNames[name] is undefined error. Raised the limits of the Zoom and Truck properties in the 2D Camera effect. 16.2.23 Fixes Fixed Sanity checks with locked layers freezing Duik and other issues with layers sharing the same names. 16.2.22 Fixes Fixed the bug preventing Duik from launching correctly through the File/Scripts/Run Script File menu entry. Fixed the too small help panel size in some specific cases. Unfortunately, we cannot restore the resizeable behaviour from previous versions due to some limitations and bugs in the scripting API of After Effects. 16.2.21 Fixes Fixed the Kleaner on non-spatial multi-dimensional properties (like scale). 16.2.20 Fixes Fixed the settingsFile is undefined error on fresh installation. Fixed the additional panels (popups) being hidden after a short period of time. Fixed the Object is Invalid error at line 134XX. The 2D Multiplane Camera now correctly creates the controllers even if a single layer is selected. 16.2.19 New Sanity checks Improvements Improved the performance of the Kleaner by 20-25%. Fixes Fixed controller extraction when some locators have been rigged/animated and don\u2019t have their default expression. Fixed additional panels not showing up on CS6. Fixed the list of commands in Duik cmd being instantly hidden. 16.2.18 New New translation: \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 A tool to automatically switch between thisComp and comp(\"Name\") in expressions. Improvements Updated some translations: Espa\u00f1ol, Fran\u00e7ais, \u4e2d\u6587 Fixes The popups don\u2019t show up outside of the screen anymore when invoked from the right or bottom edge. 16.2.17 Fixes The units in the UI of the Connector are now correctly displayed. The values of the 2D Camera effect are no longer multiplied by the expressions. Fixed broken Connectors when applied to a controller which is then extracted. When creating leg Structures, \u201cheel\u201d is now correctly translated into available languages. 16.2.16 Fixes Fixed the IK/FK Switch with extracted controllers still not working in specific cases. 16.2.15 Fixes Fixed the IK/FK Switch with extracted controllers. The bones are now correctly created with the advanced engine and 3D layers. Improvements The scale of the Effector layer is now taken into account to compute the effect. The path constraint handles a bit better the parenting of the layers. The way the expressions are built internally has been changed to ease future improvements in Duik. This should not change anything for the user, but as it\u2019s an important change, it\u2019s worth knowing and may temporarily introduce some bugs. 16.2.14 Fixes Fixed the Animation Blender tool for animators not working with compositions imported from another project. Be careful with composition names in this case! Fixed the Spring/Kleaner not working on some specific properties, like the strength of the TextEvo effect. The Get button in the controller edit panel does not change the size of the selected controllers anymore. Fixed the Auto-rig freezing in some specific cases (leg with a hoof but no foot). The Auto-rig now moves the controllers to the top of the composition even if they\u2019re nulls. Duik no longer crashes when trying to change the appearance of baked Structures. 16.2.13 Fixes Fixed Controller extraction used with parent accross comps failing in specific cases. The Parent constraint now correctly adds the expression in the Z Position of 3D Layers with dimensions separated. The Orientation constraint does not throw an expression error with the legacy engine anymore. 16.2.12 Fixes Fixed Parent constraint offset on some frames. Fixed Kleaner expression error introduced in 16.2.11 Fixed Motion Trail taper expression error introduced in 16.2.11 Fixed a few other minor issues. 16.2.11 New Parent accross comps now handles scale too. Fixes Fixed Controller extraction and Parent accross comps with (negative) scale values. Fixed multiple Controller extraction (controllers extracted twice or more) in specific cases of inter-dependencies. Fixed 2D Camera position not using the exact keyframe values. Fixed adding keys using the animation panel: now respects the all layer/selected layers option, and works with layers having markers. You can now use values lower than 1 for the width of motion trails 16.2.10 Fixes The Wheel automation now works correctly with negative scales Improved Esperanto, French and Spanish translations. 16.2.9 New Duik is now available in Esperanto too. Fixes Fixed the auto-rig freezing when rigging (at once) tail structures and spine structures without hips. Properly centered the auto-rig button on the Structures panel in Expert and God modes. Parent accross comps now works when the child layer is locked. The Time Remap tool now takes the layer in point into account. 16.2.8 Improvements When using the Kleaner through the Spring button, the Spatial Options are set to Basic instead of Simulated by default, in order to improve performance. The Auto-Parent tool now parents only orphans whith [Alt + Click]. Fixes Fixed an issue where controllers would not be linked properly after extraction (happened when some controllers were duplicated layers). 16.2.7 Improvements [Alt] + [Click] on the remove expressions button now removes expressions keeping the pre-expression value (instead of post-expression value by default) Fixes Fixed a bug where the auto-rig would freeze when rigging arms with hooves. Controller as nulls are now created as 3D layers on Cameras and Lights too. The blink automation no longer generates an expression error when the frequency is set to 0. Controller extraction now works correctly when controllers have zeroes and using master properties instead of expressions. Some issues when parenting accross compositions using master properties are fixed as well. Rigging and ungulate front leg without hoof now works correctly. Rigging a spine when set to use null layers for controllers no longer fails. 16.2.6 Improvements Tagging layers as controllers now automatically sets them to guide layers. Fixes Fixed a bug with bones set on a B\u00e9zier path on a shape layer with the legacy extendscript expression engine. Fixed a few minor bugs concerning layer parenting. 16.2.5 Improvements It is now safe to extract controllers from a duplicated rigged character, even if its controllers have already been extracted in the same composition. Holding Ctrl ] when creating [Controllers, the new controllers is now inserted in the hierarchy (i.e. the layers are parented to the controllers, and the controllers are parented to the previous parents of the layers). When extracting locators and parenting accross compositions it is now possible to use master properties (if the parent is in a precomposition, not in a \u201cparent\u201d composition). Duik will select master properties by default if the version of After Effects is more recent than 17.0. Added new Controller shapes, especially for the face. Controller icons can now be flipped (see the effect of the controller). French and Spanish translations have been completed and improved. Fixes When extracting controllers using master properties, controllers with a parent which is something else than another controller are now correctly linked. Bones are now correctly aligned to shapes inside shape layers when the containing group(s) transformation is not 0. 16.2.4 Improvements The Kleaner now generates very nice animation when the Bounce option is checked in the Follow through section. Bounces are more realistic, but it\u2019s not a real simulation: they are synchronized to the actual frames of the composition so that you always see the contact, and bounces which would be shorter than two frames are \u201csnaped\u201d to the frames anyway. This is animation! Fixes Error at line 2514 and similar errors with the \u201cDuTranslator tr()\u201d function should not happen anymore (unless the dev&debug mode is activated). Structures are now correctly duplicated using the Duplicate tool. 16.2.3 Improvements The UI for the Connector has been simplified in rookie and standard modes. The Kleaner generates a better overlap and soft-body simulation. Flexibility setting improved. The UI for the settings has been improved a bit. Fixes The Spring tool now assigns correct default values when applied to multiple layers at once. Fixed the Kleaner / Spring with 3D Layers and the legacy extendscript expression engine. Fixed the layer stopping on the last keyframe when the Kleaner is used on a position property. Improved the Kleaner performance when used in a position. Improved the Kleaner when the \u201cauto-orient to path\u201d option is turned on for the layer. Fixed Controller extraction issues, especially retro-compatibility with older versions of Duik. Fixed the Connector auto-dectection of min and max values with an IK controller. Fixed the Error at line 2514 (incorrect translation arguments). 16.2.2 Improvements The system used to display the news has been improved for better performance and better UI. Fixes Added a workaround for an After Effects bug in 17.0.0 (2020): when controller are extracted using master properties, a keyframe is added on the master property (only for this specific version of After Effects ), which fixes the controllers not rotating correctly. Fixed the undo history when using the Kleaner / Spring . Greatly improved the Pick Master Property button performance in the Connector . Greatly improved the Get Property Info tool performance. Fixed the head controller created with the auto-rig not linked to the head of the correct composition if the composition is duplicated. Fixed the options for the extract controllers tool not restored correctly (use master properties or expressions). 16.2.1 Improvements The Kleaner now has soft body and overlap options, for spatial properties, in simulation mode. The I/O tab has been removed. You can now import and export animations from the Tools tab. For other software (Storyboarder, Krita, TVPaint), a new free script will be available shortly on rainboxlab.org. The UI has been improved a bit (especially the popups). When creating a [ Controller ] as a null layer, it better detects if it should be 3D, and is placed just on top of the topmost layer. Updated the French and Spanish translations. Fixes Fixed the Kleaner / Spring for non-spatial multi-dimensionnal properties (like scale). Fixed the Kleaner / Spring not working in simulation mode if the property doesn\u2019t have at least two keyframes. Fixed the Auto-Rig not working when the spine consists only of a neck and a head. 16.2.0 New New Kleaner which does anticipations, follow-through and smart interpolations through expressions. This new tool replaces the Spring as it has the same features and many more. It also has a better performance. The Motion Trail has been completely re-built, and now has a taper option and is also able to take the 3D space and layer scale into account to automatically adjust the width of the stroke. The Extract Controllers is now able to extract only new controllers in case there have been changes made to the rig. [Alt + Click] now \u201cun-extracts\u201d the controllers from the selected precomposition. A new God Mode for the interface, which is very tiny! Improvements The interface has been improved and a bit re-organised for a faster access to most common tools. The performance of the Search and Replace tool has been greatly improved for expressions. The performance of the Structures creation and of the Auto-rig have been improved. The use of Master Properties to extract controllers has been improved for After Effects CC2020 and more recent. The Wonder Unit Storyboarder import now also imports images from the Shot Generator . The contextual help has been updated. Fixes Fixed the Storyboarder import with the latest versions of Wonder Unit Storyboarder . Fixed the head controller of the Auto-rig to make it work correctly when adding a zero. 16.1.3 Improvements You can now use custom controllers with the Auto-rig Fixes Fixed some bugs introduced in 16.1.2 (Slider controllers, effectors, and some constraints). Fixed manual IK Rigging. 16.1.2 Improvements Some expressions have been modernized, and the underlying system for generating expressions in Duik have been improved. This is going to improve performance in future versions. This work comes with a nice way to share an expression library for animators and developpers. Fixes The tool to separate dimensions of properties now removes the keyframes from the original property. The tool to separate dimension now correctly separates the dimensions of the position property too, using the After Effects native method. The connector now works correctly with \u201ccustom\u201d properties like the histogram or the mesh warp effect. Layer selectors (like the ones in the options of the Walk Cycle now work correctly when selected layers are not selected from top to bottom. B\u00e9zier IK (like the ones used in spines) no longer moves the layers on creation. B\u00e9zier IK now works on custom Structures. Fixed some tools not working in non-English Duik: Slider Controllers, Parent Constraint, Effector When extracting controllers or rigging limbs with footroll, the IK Data is now correctly linked and can be correctly detected by the new Connector 16.1.1 Fixes The connector no longer breaks project expressions when renaming comps in specific cases. The header of the controllers panel is no longer hidden in rookie and standard modes. 16.1.0 New (UX/UI) Duik is now available split in several optional pannels. This means each tab of Duik can be now in its own panel and docked separately into the user interface of After Effects. Individual panels can be opened by [Alt] + [Click] on the tab buttons. Included with this individual panels: Duik Cmd, a tiny UI with a simple command line interface for Duik. Duik now uses a welcome screen at startup, which greatly improves launch time. In order to fix any problem with Duik, like its settings file getting corrupted sometimes on Mac, there\u2019s now a way to re-initialize everything. Added some buttons with useful links: At the bottom of the panel: Bug Report and Feature Request In the help window: Forum and Live Chat New (Links & Constraints) A tool to Separate Dimensions of any property, including colors which can be animated both as RGB or HSL. The Auto-Parent tool helps you parent layers very quickly. The additional panel for the Bone now includes a button to select and show or hide all the bones in the composition. The Connector now works with a spatial effector, a texture effector or the new Expose Transform tool too. The Expose Transform tool is very useful with the Connector or to build your own expressions and automate a lot of stuff. The IK effect on controllers now exposes the distance between the end and the root of the limb, which may be very useful with the connector or in your own expressions. New (Automations) The new Effector Map tool is able to connect any property to a texture effector. New (Controllers) A tag controller tool to set any layer so Duik can recognise it as a controller (very useful for the extract controllers tool for example). Hold the [Alt] button when creating controllers to create only one controller centered on the average positions of the selected layers. Hold the [Ctrl] button to automatically parent the selected layers to the newly created controller(s). New (Other rigging tools) A tool to Align Layers in the rigging tools panel. With the Edit mode , you can (un/re)parent all the children of a layer. You can Remove expressions while keeping the post-expression value. It is easy to Copy & Paste Expressions without changing the current value of several properties at once with the copy and paste expressions buttons. Some other advanced rigging tools have been added, useful for those who create their own expressions or scripts (expert mode only): You can get some Property Info about the selected property, like its index, its matchName, the expression link to it, etc. A Scriptify expression tool makes it quick to include an expression as a string in a .jsx script. New (Other) Reimplemented and improved the TVPaint import tool from Duik 15. Duik now also imports JSON exported from TVPaint 11+, in a simpler and stabler way than the script provided by TVPaint (and with the ability to choose which layers to import). Added German translation . The interpolation adjustment tools in the Keyframes has been greatly improved, with sliders for velocity and buttons with useful predefined values. Improvements The Connector can now be used in a single click (creates a controller layer automatically). The Connector User Interface for the additionnal panel has been improved a bit to be clearer and easier to use. When used on opacities, the Connector automatically makes the layer visible. When Structures are created with something selected in the composition (Bezier paths, puppet pins, or layers), Duik will try to create these Structures on the selection and name them after the selected elements. If you hold the [Ctrl] key and there was a selection (path, pins or layers) in the composition when creating Structures , Duik will automatically link (parent or expression) the selection to the Structures . The head controller with the Autorig now controls the head position too. The preferences (and language files) of Duik are now saved by default in a \u201cDuik\u201d subfolder of your \u201cDocuments\u201d folder, instead of directly in the \u201cDocuments\u201d folder. You can still change the location of the preferences in the settings panel of Duik. The Structures colors for predefined limbs have been improved to better show the hierarchy. The User Interface has been tweaked to fix some details and improve the overall User Experience. All buttons for showing or hiding stuff (Structures, bones, controllers\u2026) can now invert the visibility with holding the [Alt] button, instead of showing or hiding them all. The Structures layer names are now translated to the language set in the settings (if the translation file is up-to-date). The Path Constraint effect now has a \u201c Path Offset \u201d option. The Add Bones button now creates a single bone if nothing is selected, which you can then use any way you want. The performance of the Search and Replace tool has been slightly improved for expressions. There\u2019s still some ongoing work to dramatically improve it\u2019s performance. Controllers as null layers are 3D layers when the selected layer is 3D. The Path Constraint can now be created in a single click. Fixes The version of Duik is now checked correctly (even for alpha and beta tests), and there is no warning if the version installed is the same than the available one. The extract controllers tool now takes the precomposition start time into account in the links, thus you can safely move the precomposed character in time. The Search and replace now correctly ignores locked layers. Adding Bones on shapes on a layer which already has some effects now works correctly. The Parent Constraint now works correctly when the composition start time is not 0. Auto-rig freezing when there\u2019s only one layer selected. Fixed some bugs when creating IK on standard layers instead of Structures . The show/hide button for Structures now works correctly. Fixed the scale expression for the 2D Camera . The Wheel and Parent Constraint now correctly generate motion blur (which can be adjusted to fix performance issues). Fixed animations not importing when interpolation values are invalid. Fixed 3D Controllers extraction. The List does not anymore add an offset on the value when added on a property without keyframes. The Move Away does not generate an expression error anymore when the layer is at the same location as its parent. Some checkboxes not working in the UI are fixed. Duik is now launched correctly on first launch if the File and Network Preference of After Effects was unchecked. The Walk Cycle is now applied correctly when controllers are null layers. Controllers are extracted without generating expression errors when using master properties. The Paint Rig now works correctly with the cloner and eraser tool too. Fixed the expressions errors in the 2D Camera on non-English After Effects. Fixed the IK/FK switch not working in some cases. 16.0.12 Fixes Fixed the Parent constraint expressions not working with the new Javascript enginge. Fixed the Check for updates failing at first start, always stating that a new version is available when it\u2019s not. Fixed the Structures creation failing in huge comps. Fixed the expression errors using the new JavaScript engine with the Framing guides . Fixed the rotation in the Camera Rig . 16.0.11 Fixes Fixed the Connector when an angle is used as a controller property and in some cases there is a jump of 360 degrees, and IK rotation values. Fixed some Structures bugs with the new JavaScript expression engine. Fixed Scale Z-Link . Fixed the Randomize tool when used on keyframe times in absolute mode. Fixed the walk cycle with the new JavaScript expression engine. 16.0.10 Improvements [Alt + Click] on the Zero button resets the position, rotation and scale of the layer. The User Interface has been tweaked to make it always better. Fixes When picking properties with Duik tools, if there is a disabled expression, it stays disabled instead of being enabled by the tool. UI: The buttons can now be clicked anywhere and not only on the text or the icon (except on CS6). Fixed the issue when sometimes two Bones were created for the same puppet pin. Fixed the expressions for the walk cycle with the new expression engine. If errors are still generated, you can jut ignore them, they\u2019ll disappear as soon as you use the controller. Slider, 2D-slider and angle controllers are no longer broken when there are layers selected in the composition before creating them. 16.0.9 Fixes The Spring expressions have been fixed and improved for After Effects 16.0 Copy/Paste animation , which was broken in 16.0.8, is fixed The Extract controllers can now extract the controllers from two rigs in the same composition. Bones on puppet pins are named after the correponding pin. Fixed Bones creation on pins with Ae CC2018 and older. The Storyboarder importer now imports empty boards too. 16.0.8 Fixes The Walk Cycle now works with the new expression engine in After Effects 16.0 16.0.7 Fixes The rigging tools panel is displaying again. Adding Bones on scaled layers no longer moves them to another location. 16.0.6 New The Bones can control the new puppet pins in After Effects 16.0: they handle the rotation and scale of the pins too. Improvements Expressions used by Duik have been improved for the new expression engine in After Effects 16.0 Fixes Random tool now correctly sets values on animated properties. Parent Constraint now works when the dimensions of the position are separated. Storyboarder import fixed (again). Extract Controllers now works correctly when dimensions are separated on the controllers. Extract Controllers now longer has an expression error on foot roll effects. The anchor size of the Controllers can now be set to 0% without generating an expression error. Fixed the Time remap tool. The parent used in a Parent contraint can now be scaled to 0% without generating an expression error. Fixed a bunch of minor bugs, stability improved. Overall stability improved (especially regarding composition names and links accross compositions). 16.0.5 New Chinese translation, thanks to eZioPan. Re-implemented the Lock Property tool from Duik 15 (in the constraints panel, Standard and Expert mode only). Improvements The Effector layer is now created as a guide layer. Fixes 2D Camera no longer crashes if there\u2019s no active composition. Extract controllers no longer fails when launched from the additionnal panel of the tool. Extract controllers and other tools are more robust and should throw less errors in unusual cases. IK/FK Switch now works with controllers extracted from a precomposition. Walk Cycle now works with controllers extracted from a precomposition. Some labels could not be translated in the User Interface and stayed in English. This is now fixed and everything should be translated in upcoming versions. Fixed some stability issues, and made some small performance improvements. Fixed the tools not working if the composition is selected from the project panel and the composition in the viewer is not the same. 16.0.4 Fixes Duik now really imports correctly Wonderunit Storyboarder files made with the latest version. 16.0.3 Fixes Duik now imports correctly Wonderunit Storyboarder files made with the latest version. 16.0.2 Improvements Duik now checks for updates and reads the news only once a day. Fixes The Framing guides are now created as guide layers. There is no longer any error when the serveur for news and updates is unavailable. 16.0.1 Fixes Fixed the Connector used with a master property which has one dimension only. 16.0.0 Improvements The Select Keyframes now works like the other tools, in a single click with an additionnal panel for the settings Parent Accross Comps now locks and hides the locators Changed controllers\u2019 label Changed structures\u2019 label Structures are selected after duplication The scale of Structures is now locked The Connector now detects the same pre-existing effects and uses them instead of creating new ones Parent Accross Comps now creates a single locator instead of one locator per child. Completed French translation Completed Documentation (but without screenshots, and still needs more details) Fixes Fixed performance issue with the Copy/paste anim (when reversed keyframes is checked). Fixed Select Keyframes tool with properties with separated dimensions. Fixed translations loading Fixed the Arm Autorig without shoulder Fixed Autorig on previously duplicated Strucutures Fixed the list not getting the initial value of the property Fixed the Autorig not detecting the side of the legs Fixed Add Bones freezing when selecting non spatial properties or groups Fixed Position Constraint which now works correctly even with parenting on the constrained layer. Fixed the automatic position of shoulders with the Autorig Fixed the neck and shoulder rotating away from their original orientation with the Autorig Fixed the Autorig run on duplicated structures Removed debug alert when using the Wiggle on single dimensionnal properties 16.0.0-RC2 Improvements Huge performance improvement at startup, with help from Lars Jandel (again). The Auto-rig is smarter: it can rig a mix between predefined limbs and custom structures UI tweaks Fixes Fixed Bezier IK and Spine Auto-rig strange behavior 16.0.0-RC1 Improvements Extract Controllers now able to extract all controllers, including the ones which are parented to any other layer, thanks to the new Parent Accross Comps tool. You now have the option to use null layers for controllers instead of shape layers ( Standard and Expert modes only) Duik can now be launched without the \u201cFile and network access\u201d preference (but with limited features and without icons). All dialogs at first start have been removed to be included in the main panel of Duik itself. Duik now checks for updates at startup (like previous versions) The help panel now includes \u201c news \u201d and \u201c about \u201d tabs to know more about Duik and Rainbox. The user guide and contextual help have been updated with a lot of new documentation. The Calculator has been removed. Lots of UI tweaks and improvements Fixes Animation Panel : the ease slider now automatically change linear keyframes to bezier with velocity set to 0. Clicking the Autorig & IK button no longer crashes Duik when there are no active composition. Duik should now work properly in Mac OS with network sessions (?). Please confirm if it\u2019s your case ;) Fixed startup in Mac OS. Fixed file extensions with exports in Mac OS Exporting to Audition with transcoding now works in Mac OS 16.0.0-Beta-1 New Duplicate Structures easily with a single button. Export and Import Animations re-implemented from Duik 15. Improvements Wonder Unit Storyboarder now handles PSD boards. Looper now has a parameter to set the number of keyframes to loop. Several FK Over IK improvements (A checkbox to disable Automatic Follow Through, animate the goal in the individual controls\u2026) Legs rigged with the Autorig and a foot roll can now be switched to FK. This is a huge improvement for walk cycle animations: as soon as the foot leaves the ground, you can swith to FK and animate very simply the rotations of the leg. Position Constraint : default weight to 0% to prevent layers from \u201cjumping\u201d away when setting the constraint. Import Animation : option to offset the values from the current ones. Import Animation : option to import all property values, or only the properties with keyframes. Import Animation : filters on property types: import only the position, or rotation, or shapes, or everything\u2026 Import Animation : option to replace existing animation or just add the new keyframes Copy/Paste Animation : option to offset the values from the current ones. Copy/Paste Animation : option to replace existing animation or just add the new keyframes Copy/Paste Animation : option to reverse keyframes Fixes Fixed the keyboard shortcuts for the Bones button in the options panel. Bones : tangents width for the bones created on shapes (CC2018) is now adjusted with the size parameter of the bone. Bones have better names when the name is too long. Fixed locator names in the Parent Accross Comps tool Fixed the character encoding issue in the contextual help on Macintosh Several Walk Cycle fixes 16.0.0-Alpha-10 New Contextual Help : Shift+Click on any tool to get some help. Animation blender is a new tool to animate using markers to trigger animations. Setup a composition with some animations and the Animation Blender , and then you just have to add some markers on the controller to trigger the animations, with an optional nice blending between each animation and the ability to loop them. Framing Guides in the Camera panel: creates handy guides in the composition to help your framing and image composition (safe frames, thirds, fibonnacci, isometric perspective\u2026) Parent accross comps is a simple way to parent a layer to another one in a parent composition, or in a precomposition, using locators and expressions. 2D Camera : new controls for predefined behaviours. Easily simulate a shoulder mount, a camera hold by hand, or on a tripod, with shake controls. Re-implemented the translation framework, and added French translation. It is now possible to add new translations to Duik. More details about this will be available on the wiki soon. Re-implemented Export to Audition from Duik 15. Export to Audition now transfers audio levels keyframes too! Improvements Wiggle : you can now control the complexity of the wiggle (octaves and mutliplier) and manually set a Random Seed to keep the same wiggle accross layers. UX/UI tweaks and improvements, stability improved. Fixes Effector set to infinite line is no longer reversed. Changing colors of controllers with Duik no longer freezes Duik. Locking In and Out ease in the animation panel now automatically adjust values according to the latest modification (on In or Out ease). Fixed the bad issue where sometimes the After Effects dialog windows would freeze Duik (and all the other scripts), and then display the \u201cCan not run a script while a modal dialog is waiting for response\u201d error when trying to launch any script again (based on an idea by _Lars Jandel. 16.0.0-Alpha-9 New Walk Cycle : the first procedural animation is available. The keyframe types button in the Animation panel can now be used to create keyframes on all animated properties. Extract controllers automatically from a precomp to your main composition, and animate outside of the precomposed character. Scale, flip, flop the character as you need. With After Effects > 15.1, extracted controllers can use Master Properties to be able to animate several instances of the same rig, in the same project. The Auto-rig is now smart enough to detect what you need if you\u2019re applying it to something else than predefined Structures . The IK and FK buttons have been removed from the Rookie UI mode, and moved into the Auto-rig options in the Standard and Expert modes. A new automation, the Looper allows to add both a loopIn and a loopOut on several properties at once, and control them with an animatable effect. The loops can be of the standard three types: \u201cCycle\u201d, \u201cOffset, \u201cPing Pong\u201d, and \u201cContinue\u201d. The Effector now has two modes: Circle or Infinite line . You can now import your traditionnal animations from Krita , just export them as CSV! Improvements Huge performance improvement. A lot of work have been made to make Duik run faster (especially the Structure creation and Autorig). Structures , Bones , and Controllers are now created with their quality set to \u201cDraft\u201d to improve performance in After Effects. FK Overlap now has individual controls for layers. FK Overlap option to (not)inherit the rotation of the parent layer. FK Overlap over IK. When an IK is created, the checkbox to deactivate IK activates individual FK controls as well as a Follow-Through & Overlap control. Added a checkbox to show/hide handles for the curvation of Bezier IK . They are now hidden by default. Added an individual control for the toes rotation in the Foot roll Add Bones is smarter: it will search for properties (with a priority for puppet pins) if there are no property selected. Add Bones adds nice effects when used on shapes, to allow the deletion of unneeded control layers afterwards. You can use an Orientation Constraint to create what was called the IK Goal in Duik 15, with much more possibilities. You can now link dimensions when using the Random tool on values. The data displayed in the IK effects is improved. The IK length is now computed in FK too, to be able to use it with the connector more reliably than using the Structure rotation. The Connector now automatically populates the \u201cmin\u201d and \u201cmax\u201d values based on the actual animation of the master property. A lot UI adjustments and improvements Fixes FK Overlap now working correctly with a parent. Bezier IK curve controller now created at a correct size, depending on the settings of the controllers. Walk Cycle now works better when there\u2019s no layer selected. The Auto-Rig for legs with foot roll now works when the structures have been rotated before running the Auto-Rig . The Search and Replace tool has been fixed. 16.0.0-Alpha-8 New Rookie Mode : An easy-to-use interface for beginners. Note: Duik will automatically switch to this mode on first start, go to the settings to set it again to standard or expert mode. Animation: IK/FK Snap and switch. Improvements IK (2 and 3 layers): rotation values are improved to prevent a \u201cjump\u201d in some cases. The rotation value on the upper part of the limb will now have a 360\u00b0 jump in the opposite direction than its orientation when the IK is created. IK (2 and 3 layers): the \u201creverse\u201d option in the effec of the controller have been moved unearthed to be more accessible. Structures : Use Alt+Click to assign a random color on creation. Bones : Use Alt+Click to assign a random color on creation. Bones : Use Ctrl+Click to create bones for vertices only, and not tangents (Quicker in case the shape does not use tangents). UI Tweaks. Lots of invisible tweaks. Some performance improvements (especially with some expressions in the Structures). Fixes List : no more error when applying on a spatial property (but spatial tangents will be lost) FK Overlap now works better even when the root has a parent. 16.0.0-Alpha-7 New FK Overlap tool, very useful for tails and ropes (or even arms)! 16.0.0-Alpha-6 New Re-implemented tools from Duik15: Camera Rig , Scale Z-Link , Import TVPaint Camera The Auto-rig now rigs tails. The Auto-rig now rigs digitigrades (cats and dogs\u2026). The Auto-rig now rigs ungulates (cattle, sheeps\u2026). Improvements Controllers scale locked on creation Controllers new shapes available Controllers : Slider , 2D Slider and Angle controllers now split in two layers: the actual control and a background. No more need to double click to animate them. Randomize UI updated to new UI style Expert Mode UI improvements Structures rotation and scale are now reset to 0 and 100% before applying IK/autorig Fixes Bezier IK not selecting the controller at the end of the creation. Bezier IK handles now working even when guides are hidden Orientation Constraint now working even if the constrained layer has a parent. 16.0.0-Alpha-5 New WonderUnit Storyboarder file import Implemented 2D Camera (renamed the 2D Multiplane from Duik 15) 2D Camera: Ability to add a layer (just duplicate any existing layer) Implemented the Autorig (legs, arms, spine but not tails or custom structures/layers yet) Improvements User Interface has been polished | The Expert mode might still have some issues which will be fixed later Layers created by Duik are now tagged with a marker. The marker can be renamed by the user, but cannot be removed: some data is stored internally to help Duik identify the layers and compute stuff. Fixes Bezier IK the \u201ccurve\u201d controller is now a position controller. Removed the Attachment Constraint which did not work as expected. Use the other constraints instead. 16.0.0-Alpha-4 Prepared Wonder Unit Storyboarder file import. 16.0.0-Alpha-3 New Animation Kleaner to clean the keyframes. Includes the Smart interpolations and Spatial Interpolations tools from previous Alpha versions. Connector able to connect to \u201cfake\u201d layer sequences using layer opacities (very powerful tool) Improvements UX: (clicking on the tab buttons sets the default panel - closes the current tool - for the tab) Connector UX/UI small improvements UI: Improved animation panel (separated keyframe tools and animation tools) Better naming conventions for controllers, bones, structures\u2026 Fixes Effector now works when re-using an existing controller layer. Randomize for properties and keyframes Connector when connecting a parent with an expression. Connector when connecting shapes and other unusual properties. IK when the root has a parent Bones on shapes with CC2018 16.0.0-Alpha-2 New Keyframe selection tool (in the animation tab) to easily batch select keyframes by type or by layers. Re-implemented tools from Duik 15: Rename , Search and replace , Measure . Improvements Simplification of the usage of the slider , 2D slider and angle controllers: the effect on the layer has been simplified and some explanations added; a keyframe is automatically added on the right property.

You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights. Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it. For the developers\u2019 and authors\u2019 protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users\u2019 and authors\u2019 sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions. Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users\u2019 freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users. Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free. The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. TERMS AND CONDITIONS 0. Definitions. \u201cThis License\u201d refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License. \u201cCopyright\u201d also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks. \u201cThe Program\u201d refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as \u201cyou\u201d. \u201cLicensees\u201d and \u201crecipients\u201d may be individuals or organizations. To \u201cmodify\u201d a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a \u201cmodified version\u201d of the earlier work or a work \u201cbased on\u201d the earlier work. A \u201ccovered work\u201d means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program. To \u201cpropagate\u201d a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well. To \u201cconvey\u201d a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying. An interactive user interface displays \u201cAppropriate Legal Notices\u201d to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion. 1. Source Code. The \u201csource code\u201d for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. \u201cObject code\u201d means any non-source form of a work. A \u201cStandard Interface\u201d means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language. The \u201cSystem Libraries\u201d of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A \u201cMajor Component\u201d, in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it. The \u201cCorresponding Source\u201d for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work\u2019s System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work. The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source. The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work. 2. Basic Permissions. All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law. You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you. Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary. 3. Protecting Users\u2019 Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law. No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures. When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work\u2019s users, your or third parties\u2019 legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures. 4. Conveying Verbatim Copies. You may convey verbatim copies of the Program\u2019s source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program. You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee. 5. Conveying Modified Source Versions. You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date. b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to \u201ckeep intact all notices\u201d. c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it. d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so. A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an \u201caggregate\u201d if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation\u2019s users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate. 6. Conveying Non-Source Forms. You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways: a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange. b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge. c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b. d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements. e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d. A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work. A \u201cUser Product\u201d is either (1) a \u201cconsumer product\u201d, which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, \u201cnormally used\u201d refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product. \u201cInstallation Information\u201d for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made. If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM). The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network. Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying. 7. Additional Terms. \u201cAdditional permissions\u201d are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions. When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission. Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms: a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors. All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \u201cfurther restrictions\u201d within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying. If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms. Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way. 8. Termination. You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11). However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation. Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice. Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10. 9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies. You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so. 10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients. Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License. An \u201centity transaction\u201d is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party\u2019s predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts. You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it. 11. Patents. A \u201ccontributor\u201d is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor\u2019s \u201ccontributor version\u201d. A contributor\u2019s \u201cessential patent claims\u201d are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, \u201ccontrol\u201d includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License. Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor\u2019s essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version. In the following three paragraphs, a \u201cpatent license\u201d is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To \u201cgrant\u201d such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party. If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. \u201cKnowingly relying\u201d means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient\u2019s use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid. If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it. A patent license is \u201cdiscriminatory\u201d if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007. Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law. 12. No Surrender of Others\u2019 Freedom. If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program. 13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License. Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such. 14. Revised Versions of this License. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License \u201cor any later version\u201d applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy\u2019s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program. Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version. 15. Disclaimer of Warranty. THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \u201cAS IS\u201d WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 16. Limitation of Liability. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16. If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee. END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms. To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the \u201ccopyright\u201d line and a pointer to where the full notice is found. <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.> Copyright (C) <year> <name of author> This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version. This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details. You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program. If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>. Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail. If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode: <program> Copyright (C) <year> <name of author> This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details. The hypothetical commands `show w\u2019 and `show c\u2019 should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, your program\u2019s commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \u201cabout box\u201d. You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a \u201ccopyright disclaimer\u201d for the program, if necessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see https://www.gnu.org/licenses/ . The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License. But first, please read https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html .","title":"GNU GPLv3"},{"location":"misc/gnu-gpl.html#gnu-general-public-license","text":"Version 3, 29 June 2007 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. https://fsf.org/ Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.","title":"GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE"},{"location":"misc/gnu-gpl.html#preamble","text":"The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works. The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program\u2013to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too. When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things. To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others. For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights. Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it. For the developers\u2019 and authors\u2019 protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users\u2019 and authors\u2019 sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions. Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users\u2019 freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users. Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary.

To \u201cpropagate\u201d a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well. To \u201cconvey\u201d a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying. An interactive user interface displays \u201cAppropriate Legal Notices\u201d to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.

This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b. d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge.

But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM). The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network. Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.","title":"6.
