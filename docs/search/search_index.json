If you don\u2019t find the answer to your question it may be because the answer is already somewhere else in the user guide. If after searching in the guide you still can\u2019t find the solution to your problem, you\u2019re welcome to ask on chat.rxlab.info How can I modify the design of an already rigged (and animated) character? When you rig a character, you should follow the standard Duik procedure ( cf. The Rigging Process in Duik \u00c1ngela ). When using bones to rig the character, the artwork is not rigged itself, all constraints and expressions are on the bones. This means you can change the design at any time by just swapping the artwork, or adding layers to be parented to the rigged bones. This being said, a nice habit to have is to always precompose all footage as soon as you import them, and use the precomps instead of the footage. This makes it easy to adjust the design at any time, by just modifying the contents of these precompositions. This works especially well when using the puppet tool, as the pins will be on the precomposition instead of the footage itself. This way you can easily change anything you wish inside the precomposition without having to redo the puppet and parenting work. Of course, you can only change details on the character this way; if the location of the joints change, it\u2019s usually easier and faster to just redo the rig. Don\u2019t forget you can remove just a single limb to re-rig it, you don\u2019t need to re-rig the whole character. Can I use the same rig for multiple characters? Yes, if the characters all have the same proportions (if the length of their limbs, the distance between the joints are all the same). No in all other cases, sorry. This being said, it\u2019s quite quick to create a bunch of bones and run the Auto-Rig, not much longer than having to reposition existing bones (it may even be faster due to performance issues with rigged characters). We could implement a tool to reposition already rigged bones, that\u2019d be a great new feature in Duik, but it\u2019s too complicated for now and all the other great new features we have to add first. How can I scale a rigged character in Duik? It is not possible to scale the rig itself yet without adjusting some expressions, but: With the \u201cExtract Controllers\u201d feature, you can scale a rigged character: Add the rigged comp into another comp. Select the precomposition layer and, in the controllers panel of Duik, click on \u201cExtract controllers\u201d You can then animate from outside of the precomp, with the extracted controllers, and you can scale the precomposition layer to scale the rig (the controllers will follow). We think this is a good workaround, you just have to take care of the resolution as it\u2019s a precomposition (and rasterization may not work properly with the rig), scaling up will damage it a bit, but scaling it down is ok. How can I use the connector to connect a single slave property to multiple master properties? Use a List ! The hominoid (or other meta-rigs) is facing left. I\u2019d like it to face right. The direction the hominoid is facing doesn\u2019t really matter, as the Auto-Rig will adjust to the locations of the armatures at the time you\u2019ll run it. Just move each bone to the corresponding limb of your character, one by one, and then run the Auto-Rig. Don\u2019t forget the Edit Mode to help you move a Structure without moving its children if you need. When applying the walk cycle, the controllers of the hands seem to be deactivated, why\u2019s that? The procedural walk cycle animates the arms with Forward Kinematics (FK) and thus deactivates the Inverse Kinematics (IK). They do not need to translate anymore as the animation is on the angles of the individual FK controls. If you want to animate/adjust the arms, you can either adjust the values in the Individual FK controls in the effects of the controllers, or you can re-enable the IK, but this will deactivate the procedural animation on the arms. Note You can animate the switch between IK and FK, and Duik provides a tool to ease this IK/FK switch process. FK on legs don\u2019t seem to work: the foot is detached from the leg Because of the way the foot roll is rigged 1 , legs can\u2019t be animated using FK if they\u2019ve been rigged with the Auto-Rig, as you rarely need FK on legs but very often need the foot roll controls. To be able to animate a leg using FK (but without foot roll controls), there are two ways: Rig it as a hominoid front leg (arm) 1 . Create a custom rig, with a standard IK 2 . Duik worked well, but it won\u2019t start anymore. What can I do? Sometimes, the files Duik needs to run smoothly get corrupted, especially (but not only) on Mac OS or when something like OneDrive or DropBox is messing with your documents folder. If this is the case, Duik may not even be able to start anymore, or may be showing a script alert at start. In this case, follow the procedure described in the Troubleshooting section to repair Duik. Where can I get help with Duik? You\u2019re reading this guide, that\u2019s an important first step. If you\u2019d prefer some video tutorials, we provide lots of official free tutorials and paid comprehensive courses on rxlaboratory.org and lots high quality free and paid tutorials are available on the internet. Of course, we\u2019ll be happy to guide you on chat.rxlab.info , but please, do not contact us through social networks or our contact form to get support and help with Duik or any other tool: we just can\u2019t reply to everyone everywhere. I can\u2019t afford to contribute or I don\u2019t want to donate, can I still use Duik? Our software is free, as in freedom . You have the same rights whether you make a donation or not. Not everyone can afford to give some money, and we\u2019re fine with that. Note that we welcome any kind of contribution, there\u2019s always something to do, like translations, fixing bugs, contributing to the doc, creating examples and tutorials\u2026 There\u2019s always a download link available on the official website (rxlaboratory.org) to let you download Duik for free. Do NOT download Duik from anywhere else! You probably won\u2019t find the latest version, and you may just end-up with a virus too. Why do you call your tools Free Software if I have to pay for it? On the download page of Duik, we ask professionals to make a financial contribution before downloading Duik, because we think that\u2019s fair for them to contribute if they make money with our tool. You have to understand the word free as in freedom or in free speech \u2013 what we call Libre in French \u2013 and not as in free beer. We\u2019ve tried for more than ten years to deliver everything we do for completely free, relying only on voluntarily donations, and that just wasn\u2019t enough for us to continue our work. So we have to sell the software, but you\u2019re still free to use it as you wish, redistribute it (for free if you wish), modify it, and share your modifications. This being said, it\u2019s not actually mandatory to make a financial contribution.

Contribute Code If you\u2019re a fellow developer, either beginner or experienced, you\u2019re welcome to contribute to the development of Duik. Most of the work happens on our dedicated repository which you can quickly find at source.rxlab.io . If you don\u2019t know how to use Git yet, start by testing that. It\u2019s not difficult. This is the usual way to submit changes to the code: Start by cloning the repo . This is easily done right from the repository website. Clone your instance of the repo locally to your computer, using either the command line or any Git GUI application (a list is available on git-scm.com ). Then you can start to code . Commit your changes regularly, and push them, using either the command line or your Git GUI application application. Submit a pull request to our repository so we can review your changes. This is easily done right from the repository website. As you can see, the process is quite easy to follow, and everything can be done with a UI if you\u2019re not so familiar with command line interfaces. Don\u2019t worry if you\u2019re not sure about what you\u2019re doing, don\u2019t be shy. We\u2019ll review and fix (or ask you to fix) your code before it\u2019s integrated into Duik, and help you learn. We\u2019re doing everything we can so everyone feels included and safe in every place you\u2019ll be in touch with us. We\u2019ve all been beginners ;) If you need help, if you\u2019d like to submit a piece of code, an example, your own script, or anything else which would not fit the process described above, don\u2019t hesitate to contact us, either using our contact form: contact.rxlab.info or through our chat server: chat.rxlab.info to have a little chat!

When you\u2019re reading the documentation online, an Edit button should be available at the top right corner of the page. Just click it to submit your changes; we\u2019ll review and make the changes available quickly. Don\u2019t worry if you don\u2019t see the change after you edit the page, it has to be accepted first and it\u2019s not automatically published. The documentation uses the Markdown 1 syntax: the source is made of simple text files following this syntax, and the html web pages are generated from this using a tool called MkDocs . You\u2019ll see that Markdown is very simple to use and quick to learn. The link to the Duik online documentation is duik.rxlab.guide Tutorials The more tutorials available, the better! Don\u2019t hesitate to record either quick tips and tricks or complete courses. Post them on your favorite streaming service, paid or free, in any language, and let us know so we can share them! If you\u2019d like and if your tutorial meets our quality requirements, it could become an \u201c official \u201d tutorial for your language which will include on the RxLab website and even add to our shop. Contact us if you feel your tutorial or course deserves it. Translate We\u2019re trying to make Duik available in as many languages as possible. When we develop the tools, they\u2019re written in English first (as all programming languages use English keywords that makes things easier). But we\u2019d like them to use Esperanto 2 as a default language, because there\u2019s no reason English should be the international language, la internacia lingvo . Of course, it is, and that won\u2019t change tomorrow, but we\u2019re trying to show it could be different. The best would be that any user could use the tools in the language of its choice. We\u2019ve noticed that when a tool is translated, its use grows a lot in countries where the new translation is spoken. These are the languages the most used by the users of Duik: (Esperanto) English French Spanish Chinese Portuguese Japanese German \u2026 But any translation in any language is welcome! Technically, to translate Duik, we use open PO files . To edit these translations, we use the online collaborative platform Crowdin , but we also recommend using free apps like PoEdit or Virtaal if you prefer to download the files and work offline. These files can also be easily edited with any text editor application. When you decide to help to translate Duik, it\u2019s best to first join us on our chat server: chat.rxlab.info so we can help you, and you can exchange with other translators in your language or other languages. Via Crowdin The easiest way to help translate the tools is to create a free account on Crowdin.com and start contributing to the project of your choice. You\u2019ll find the Duik project on translate.rxlab.io If the language you\u2019re willing to translate to is not listed yet, just ask us and we\u2019ll add it right away! Via an application If you prefer to translate the tools using an application, you\u2019ll first have to download the translation files to edit them. You\u2019ll find them either on the corresponding repository at source.rxlab.io or Crowdin project at translate.rxlab.io . First, create a free account on the platform, then download the files. Once you\u2019re finished, you\u2019ll just have to send them back (post them on our chat server at chat.rxlab.io , or attach them to an issue on the repository, or create a pull request , or upload them to Crowdin , your choice!). Bug reports and feature request If you find a bug (sorry!) or have a feature to request for a specific Rx Open Tool, let us know! It\u2019s very important we get feedback from the users to keep improving all the tools. No matter what, all bug requests and feature requests must be posted on issue.rxlab.io . But it\u2019s a good idea to first join us on our chat server: chat.rxlab.io to make sure the issue is not already known or fixed, or if you need any help at all. Communicate, share, repost\u2026 The more we are, the more contributors we get, the better will be our work. Every time you post something you\u2019ve made using one of the Rx Open Tools, show it!

This means that the image displayed by the After Effects viewport is pixel-accurate. Its priority is image quality against performance; to the contrary of most animation applications, where you have to render the animation to get the final high-quality video, After Effects\u2019 goal is to let you work directly on the final image. After Effects is not a character rigging and animation application. Animating characters in After Effects is interesting though, thanks to it letting you work directly on the actual, rendered, animation. After Effects is very good at manipulating pixel assets (better than vectors), which makes it a decent software for cut-out character animation. These last two decades, a lot of third-party tools were built on top of these features, specifically made for character animation; Duik was the first in 2008, followed by others ( Rubberhose , Joystick and Sliders , etc.). Before that, there was no proper character rigging in After Effects, and it was fine. Duik and these other tools brought high-level rigging and animation to After Effects, and great films were made with this technique, but it also brought a lot of performance issues. The way a compositing application like After Effects works is not made for performance. It is important to always keep in mind what is going to slow down After Effects when animating characters and props, to be able to organize your projects in a way to limit these performance issues, and adjust the settings of your tools accordingly. Choose the right tool Honestly, if you\u2019re in some kind of very advanced rigging and animation project, if you\u2019re in top-level quality and need both performance and versatility, After Effects may not be the right choice. Did you know South Park 1 was made with Maya 2 ? Why don\u2019t you animate in Blender 3 with a nice rig? You can rig 2D characters in 3D software, and you won\u2019t have performance issues there. But let\u2019s agree that sometimes, it\u2019s easier and quicker to use less applications, to not have to render animations between different applications and to animate in the same software which will be used for compositing. In this case, Duik is the tool you need for character animation in After Effects. Note Some explanations here might not be perfectly accurate about how After Effects works (there are caching systems and other tricks to improve performance we won\u2019t explain here), but the point is to explain where to look at to improve performance. Summary Here\u2019s a checklist of what you can do to improve the performance in After Effects, from most to less important. Read the next sections for detailed explanations about these suggestions. Set the preview quality to Off (Final Quality) . Don\u2019t leave it to Adaptive Resolution . Lower the preview resolution if you can (to Half or Third ). Don\u2019t leave it to Auto . Hide, and shy, unneeded layers. Hide the layer controls ( Ctrl + Shift + H ). Cut/hide all layers as soon as they\u2019re outside of the frame of the composition. Render or precompose (with a proxy!) the Shape Layers. Always precompose layers before duplicating them, if what you need is an exact copy. Bake expressions whenever you can, remove or deactivate unnneeded expressions (the ones which don\u2019t actually animate anything). Precompose the animated characters and props, and render proxies for them before compositing. Don\u2019t use essential properties. Use image sequences; Render to openEXR instead than PNG . Avoid the puppet tool. Restart After Effects every hour. Keep the After Effects project as small as possible. Some tools are more compute-intensive than others. You have to know which ones to avoid or to optimize to fix performance issues in your rigs. You must know that Duik only uses native After Effects features, it automates things you could do by yourself (provided you have a lot of time to spend at it). This means it is not Duik by itself which causes performance issues, it is how native After Effects features are used together and how many of them at the same time. Next is a non-exhaustive list of features you have to be careful with. Preview quantity and quality This is not what will improve performance the most, but it\u2019s measures you can take without making any compromise on the features of your rig. When animating, you can downgrade the quality of the preview, and the quantity of layers displayed. Do you really need to display the Bones and Pins ? Do Bones and Controllers really need anti-aliasing, or could they be set to draft mode? Actually, do controllers need to be shape layers or could they be simple nulls? Do all layers have to be vectors or could they be pre-rendered to an image format? These are the kind of questions you have to ask yourself. There are a few options to speed up the preview and your workflow in After Effects. You can set the overall quality of the preview. The default option, Adaptive Resolution , does not seem to be the best choice, as constantly changing the resolution of the preview when moving layers does not feel fluid at all. Off (Final Quality) does feel way more fluid when working, as does Fast Draft . There\u2019s actually not much difference between Fast Draft and Off (Final Quality) \u2026 You can change the resolution of the preview. Again, the default one, Auto may not be the best for fluidity if you have this habit a lot of people have to constantly zoom in and out, to work details and have an overall look at the image, and if you don\u2019t always do RAM previews at the same level of zoom. In this case, After Effects will be constantly rendering the preview at different resolutions and this has a very bad impact on performance and fluidity. It may be best to wisely choose a resolution and stick to it. Most of the time, when animating in HD or 2K compositions (or bigger), Half resolution or even Third is enough. You can change the quality of the preview per layer too. In the attributes of the layer, clicking this icon will disable anti-aliasing and other algorithms which are not needed for animation, and this may improve performance a bit. Do the controllers really need the best quality? The quantity of layers enabled greatly impacts the performance of the user interface. Solo and shy the layers as much as possible, hide anything not needed. For this workflow, our other free tool DuGR 4 can be a great help, and it is fully compatible with Duik. Read below for more information about it. Layers The type of layers you use is of great importance to improve the performance. This table lists them from worst to best in terms of performance. Type Notes Complex Shape Layers Shape layers with a lot of content or many expressions are the worst. Simple Shape Layers Very simple shape layers, with just a few shapes and without heavy expressions are much better, but are still a bit slower than raster layer to render. Raster Layers Raster layers (pixels, a.k.a. bitmaps) just need to be displayed, there\u2019s nothing to compute (except effects of course). Null Layers As they\u2019re empty, their impact on performance is negligible. Simple Shape Layers, controls hidden When hiding layer controls ( Ctrl + Shift + H ), the performance is much better, for all types of layers, except complex shapes. Raster Layers, controls hidden Null Layers, controls hidden As Null layers consist only of layer controls, hiding the layer controls means they don\u2019t have any impact on the performance (except for parenting and expressions in the transform properties) As you can see in this table, there are two ways to improve the performance of the viewport and the rendering performance in After Effects: Always hide the layer controls . This is by far the best way to improve performance in After Effects when manipulating layers. The option is available in the View \u25b6 View Options... menu in After Effects, and they can be quickly toggled with the Ctrl + Shift + H shortcut. You may have to do this quite regularly as its a pre-composition option. Always prefer raster layers . A raster layer will almost always be faster to render than a shape layer. If you don\u2019t need to animate the contents of a shape layer, you could precompose it, or, even better, render it to an openEXR file and replace the shape with the rendered image. Tip It seems the performance is a bit better (approximately 10 %) with a shape layer containing many shapes than with everything exploded in several layers. Cut/hide invisible layers Quite often, when animating some layers position, they may be (temporarily) outside of the frame of the composition. In this case, performance may be improved if you hide/cut them as soon as they get out, to be sure to prevent any rendering and evaluation of the expressions which are not needed as long as the layer can\u2019t be seen. This is also true if for some time a layer is hidden beneath other layers, cutting it may improve performance. Render the Shape Layers Every time you use a b\u00e9zier shape, After Effects has to rasterize it before it can display it and render the composition. This means the more shape layers you have, the lower the performance will be. Whenever it\u2019s possible, you should precompose the shape layer, to the smallest composition you can: this way the precomposition is a raster layer, a bitmap with actual pixels, and faster to render. You can even render this precomposition to an image sequence to replace it or use it as a proxy. Proxies are great! Of course, do not check the continuous rasterization option on the precomposition layer or you\u2019ll lose all benefits of the precomposition. Read the Precompositions section below for more information. Tip A shape layer without animation nor expressions in its content should always be replaced by an image. Especially when using the puppet tool! As it works with the rendered pixels and not with the vector data, you won\u2019t lose quality, there\u2019s no need to keep the vectors. And precomposing the shape will fix a lot of issues\u2026 Tip Even if the shape layer uses expressions in its content, it can be a good idea to precompose it. This way, you could temporarily freeze time on the precomposition layer to disable all expressions inside and improve the performance when animating, and only remove the time remapping to adjust details and render the final animation. You could also render a proxy of the precomposition to keep the final result while animating other parts. It is NOT a good idea to use shapes hoping to be able to scale them. It will have a bad impact on performance, scaling is another step in the render process which takes some time. Especially if you have a lot of shape layers. Scaling rigs is very complicated as it will probably break a lot of expressions. Before working your animation, you should always draw a storyboard; this way you know which sizes are needed for your character and you can build a different rig for each. When you see only a close up on the torso and the head, do you really need the rig of the legs? When the character is far away, do you really need complex facial expressions? Will you even draw the character the same way? If you\u2019re using vectors only for scaling purposes, you can rasterize them (at a higher resolution if really needed) and greatly improve performance. Duik Bones Duik Bones are Shape Layers and thus have a bad impact on performance. This is not a big issue though, as they\u2019re not meant to be displayed; when hidden, their performance impact is negligible, especially if they\u2019re baked . This being said, with all their envelops and noodles , they quickly become complicated to manipulate. If you don\u2019t need these advanced features, you have the option to use simpler bones, displayed as small dots, which are much lighter. Even when using these simpler bones, there are still a few expressions to control their appearance. To further improve performance, you can bake the bones to remove these expressions. By default, the bones are automatically baked when running the auto-rig. \u25b7 Read the Bones and Autorig section for more information about these options. Duik Controllers By default, Duik uses Shape Layers for controllers too. This enables the dynamic display of some guides and helpers directly inside the controller layer contents, but, again, this has a bad impact on performance. If you don\u2019t need these guides, there are two ways to avoid using shape layers as controllers: Use raster layers ( PNG images imported into the project, or custom layers you\u2019ve created). In this case, you can still use a nice icon to identify the controllers, and you can hide the layer controls ( Ctrl + Shift + H ) to achieve the best performance. If you\u2019d like to customize the appearance of the controllers, like you would do with shape layers, you can use some simple effects, like the transform effect to move and scale the icon, and the fill effect to change its color. Even with these effects, the performance is better than shape layers. Use null layers . Null layers have a great performance, but they\u2019re completely invisible if you hide layer controls, and can\u2019t be customized as nicely as standard layers. It\u2019s nice that they\u2019re automatically hidden when previewing an animation though. When using raster layers or null layers as controllers, the performance of the rig is much better; but if you still want or need to use shape layers, you can also bake their appearance to make things a bit better. Shape layer controllers are automatically baked by default when extracting controllers from a precomposed rig. \u25b7 Read the Controllers section for more information about these options. Expressions Expressions in After Effects are all evaluated (computed) when rendering each frame of the composition . This won\u2019t be an issue if they are simple, with basic calculations like the vast majority of expressions you may write by yourself. Now, imagine an expression, which, when it is evaluated (i.e. at each frame of the composition), needs to compute previous movements of some other layers - this is what simulations do. This means it also needs to compute everything which influences the layers in previous frames of the composition, including other expressions, which might be complex too\u2026 This is a nasty situation where performance will drop dramatically 5 . Some features of Duik use very complex expressions , and compute-intensive calculations, like the IK which involves more maths than simple additions and multiplications, or simulations like the kleaner\u2019s follow-through which have to compute previous movements. Even if we\u2019ve been hard at work to fix performance issues, in some cases combining a lot of expressions (i.e. Duik features) can lead to poorer performance when animating, or even so much lag that the rig cannot be correctly manipulated anymore. Note Don\u2019t worry about simple expressions you create manually, like links between properties, or simple wiggles, etc. They\u2019re not a problem, even if you have hundreds of them. When dealing with complex expressions, just remember that the more expressions = the more performance issues you\u2019ll have. In the end, expressions are just animations and could be replaced by keyframes to improve the performance. After Effects can bake the expressions to keyframes for you, with the Animation \u25b6 Keyframe Assistant \u25b6 Convert Expression to Keyframes menu entry. This creates one keyframe per frame, then deactivates the expression. Duik can also help you with that: the bake expression tool in the Automation and expressions panel has two better ways to convert expressions to keyframes: A smart mode creates an animation as close as possible to the result of the expression, using just a few B\u00e9zier keyframes, and keeps the animation easy to edit later. A precise mode creates an animation with as much keyframes as needed for a perfect match (which is still less than the After Effects native tool). B\u00e9zier paths and expressions For some reason, using an expression to control the B\u00e9zier path of a mask is much slower than the same expression in a shape layer : if you need to use expressions with B\u00e9zier path, try to always use shape layers instead of masks! We\u2019ve measure the same expression to be twice faster in shape layers. Compositions The more complex a composition becomes, the slower it is to render; complex compositions with too many layers also have a really bad impact on the user interface of After Effects. The less layers there are in a composition, the better it is. Hide layers you don\u2019t need to improve the rendering performance. The number of layers displayed in the timeline influences a lot the performance of the user interface. There are two ways to improve that: Use the Shy Mode to reduce the number of displayed layers. Reduce the size of the timeline panel to display less layers at once. The timeline displayed vertically, with many layers, is very laggy, but the performance is much better with a horizontal timeline displaying only a few layers, even if the composition contains hundreds of them. Precompositions Precompositions are an under-estimated way to improve performance. Precomposing several layers reduces the number of layers displayed in the timeline and improves the performance of the user interface, and, used wisely, precompositions can greatly improve the rendering performance. Each time you duplicate a layer, you have to ask yourself if you can precompose it first in any way and then duplicate the precomposition. Very often, you can precompose! Tip Keep in mind that you can use expressions to link stuff from the precomposition to the main composition. With the Parent across compositions tool of Duik, you can even parent a layer in a precomposition to a layer outside of it. The Extract Controllers tool can be of great help too. When you precompose before duplicating the layer(s), all its transformation and effects will be rendered only once and only then they will be duplicated. Without precomposition, everything has to be rendered twice (or more if you duplicate again the same layer). Warning If you enable the continuous rasterization option, you\u2019ll lose all benefits of the precomposition on the rendering performance, as After Effects will re-render all layers inside the composition each time it is used with the option activated. Proxies Proxies are a great way to improve the performance when using precompositions. By rendering the composition and using the rendered frames, you can bake lots of layers in your project, and if these proxies are full-quality openEXR files for example, you can even use the proxies for the final render in the end. By rendering proxies at each step of your work, you also save rendering time for the final render. Note that this also saves memory needed for the final render, and can help you deliver more complex projects even on lower-end computers. Essential properties When using a lot of precompositions, it may be tempting to use lots of essential properties. But essential properties must be avoided at all costs! Each time a composition uses at least an essential property, that means it has to be re-rendered instead of re-using the previous cached rendered image of the same composition. This also means it gets much more complicated to use proxies with these compositions\u2026 Essential properties also have a lower performance than simple expression links; to control a property inside a precomposition, an expression will always be better. The difference may not be noticeable for a single property, but with lots of essential properties, the performance drops dramatically. A few tools in Duik like extract controllers have the option to use either expressions or essential properties. It is advised to use expressions whenever possible. DuGR, Layer groups To handle lots of layers, we\u2019ve developed another tool called DuGR 4 . By grouping layers, it makes it easy to isolate them, both in the timeline or the viewport (using solo and shy modes). This helps to improve the performance in two ways: By reducing the number of layers displayed in the timeline, the performance of the user interface gets better. By creating simpler, schematic versions of your characters and props to be used during the animation process, you can use DuGR to switch between the simplified layers and the final render. Note Rafael Arame 6 explains this very well in a nice article about how he uses DuGR 4 to improve the performance of his complex rigs, which you can read on rxlab.info/rafael-dugr . Project Big projects can lead to a lot of issues. The number of items displayed in the project panel influences the performance of the user interface (try to keep the project panel as small as possible, and close folders). Big files are longer to read and write, and raise the probability of sync issues or corrupt files. It is a good habit to animate a single shot per project; do not store everything into a single After Effects project! Try to keep the project files as small as possible, and regularly reduce the project to remove unused items. The sanity tests included in Duik keep track of your project size and the number of items in it to help you keep it small. Project Settings A few settings can be tweaked per project to improve a bit the performance. Video Rendering and Effects If you have a compatible GPU, you should always leave this option to use Mercury GPU Acceleration , unless you have rendering issues or GPU driver issues. Expressions It is said that the new JavaScript engine is faster than the Legacy ExtendScript engine, but if that\u2019s true, it doesn\u2019t seem to be measurable. What\u2019s true is that some expressions may not work on both engines: some expressions may work only on the legacy engine while others only on the JavaScript engine. All expressions used by Duik should be compatible with both engines, but sometimes switching the engine may fix some bugs. In doubt, always use the new JavaScript engine. Formats Not all formats are equal. If you\u2019ve understood what we wrote just above, you may be beginning to use more image formats and less shapes, whether it\u2019s for proxies or final render. What formats should be used? When rendering animations, most of the time it\u2019s better and easier to use image sequences than video files. There is at least one very good and simple reason for it: if the render fails, you won\u2019t have to start it all again, but just the remaining frames. If you want to change something in the animation, you will only have to render the corresponding frames. You should use a format which suits your needs (color depth, alpha channel), but also a format which is fast to read and write by After Effects! Our advice is to use OpenEXR (with PIZ (lossless) or DWA (slightly lossy) compression) which handles 32bpc, and has an alpha channel. It is also way faster to read/write than PNG in After Effects, and files are usually smaller with EXR . It\u2019s better than the RAW format of your camera, it\u2019s great for storing HDRi. Premiere and other editing software, as well as Photoshop, can read them; as specified in the name, they\u2019re open and widely compatible. What more could you ask for? Tip You can render the audio to a simple *.wav file stored next to the image sequence. If you still prefer using video files, you should choose a format which is also as fast as possible to read and write. Avoid H.264 and H.265 ( mp4 , etc.) and prefer intra-frame codecs like Apple ProRes , Avid DnxHD , or Quicktime Animation . Note that, although it\u2019s widely used, ProRes (and DnxHD / DnxHR ) is a lossy codec which outputs huge files. OpenEXR sequences or Quicktime Animation are lossless (or optionally very slightly lossy if you wish even smaller files with EXR ) and usually output much smaller files. After Effects Memory leaks The most important thing to know about After Effects is that there are memory leaks. This means that the longer you use it, the more memory it will use, and part of this memory is completely wasted. This is especially true when using scripts, it is a known issue in After Effects that scripts are never freed from memory even if they\u2019re closed and have finished everything they\u2019re doing (the technical term is garbage collection , and this garbage collection just doesn\u2019t work for scripts). This clearly slows down After Effects after a certain amount of time and use. Until this kind of issues are all fixed, the only way to keep your app as fast as possible is to restart it regularly to completely free the memory. Even the Edit \u25b6 Purge menu is of no use about this issue. User Interface It is a well-known fact that the user interface of After Effects, is, to say the least, sluggish\u2026 If there aren\u2019t too many items to be shown, it\u2019s usually okayish, but it quickly becomes a pain to navigate panels with a lot of items\u2026 Which is usually the case of the most important one, the timeline panel, with a lot of layers and keyframes. There\u2019s nothing we can do about that, and it\u2019s one of the main reason why you should learn animation in another application (like Blender) if you can. This problem has another less-known implication: scripts are (very) slow. In After Effects, scripts run in the same thread as the user interface. This itself could be seen as a design flaw, although at the time this was designed, multi-threading was not the thing it is today. But the real problem is that when a script is running, there\u2019s no way to stop the user interface to try to follow. Each operation a script does, the user interface tries to reflect it. And the script has to wait for the user interface to finish this (slow) operation to continue onto its next step (because it lives in the same thread). Although the actual operation the script does could be very fast, it is slowed down by the user interface of After Effects. For example, a script creating a few dozens of new keyframes on some properties will be slowed down for each keyframe creation by the user interface actually showing the new keyframe (instead of waiting for the script to finish and draw them all at once). This would not be so much of an issue if the user interface wasn\u2019t so slow\u2026 There\u2019s no solution here, except that now you know it, you can talk about it with Adobe. Preferences Sometimes, changing a few options in After Effects can improve the performance or fix issues. In most cases, leaving the default values should work well, but it may be useful to have a look at these specific preferences: Previews \u25b6 Viewer Quality : Set the Zoom Quality to Faster or More Accurate Except Cached Preview to improve a bit the performance when the viewer zoom is not set at 100 %. Note that the difference is hardly noticeable, but sometimes, every little improvement is good to have. You can do the same for the Color Management Quality for color-managed projects. Previews \u25b6 Cache Frames When Idle : This can also be toggled per composition in the Composition \u25b6 Preview menu. Caching frames when After Effects is idle does improve the performance, as sometimes frames will already be cached when you start working on a composition. But with very long compositions this can cause lots of issues by filling your computer\u2019s memory. In this case, all your programs may start to behave erratically or even crash after everything begins to lag a lot. Display \u25b6 Motion Path : Displaying too long motion paths can be very laggy, especially if the motion path is the result of complex expressions. Be careful with that; it may be better to deactivate completely the motion paths and enable them only when needed. Unfortunately, there\u2019s no shortcut for that, but Duik may include a button for that in the future. Display \u25b6 Disable Thumbnails in Project Panel : This option doesn\u2019t really improve the performance, but again, sometimes with very big projects, every little improvement helps. Media & Disk Cache \u25b6 Disk Cache : When the disk cache is enabled, After Effects will save rendered frames to a temporary location on a specified disk. This is needed if your system runs with low RAM memory. If you have a lot of available memory (more that 32 or even 64GB) when working with After Effects, it may improve performance to disable the disk cache: in this case, After Effects saves the frames only into RAM, which is much faster than any disk. But in this case, you\u2019ll lose all the cache when closing After Effects or restarting your computer, to the contrary of the disk cache. A way to benefit from both worlds is to create a Ram Disk , read below for more information. No matter what, you should always choose a location on the fastest (SSD) possible disk on your system, separate from the disk containing your footage if possible. Memory & Performance \u25b6 Memory : Be careful with this option: due to the memory leaks explained in the previous section, the memory limit is not actually respected! It is easy to show that After Effects memory can be much higher than the limit set here, by just running a complex script (like Duik) a few times. Memory & Performance \u25b6 Performance : Using Multi-Frame Rendering usually improves performance, but in specific cases it may be better to deactivate this option: if you work with complex compositions, lots of expressions, or non-compatible effects, multi-frame rendering may actually slow down the rendering process: It takes more time to start the rendering process when using multi-frame rendering. This can be a problem for previews: if you notice a long delay between requesting the preview and the render of the first frame, it may be because of multi-frame rendering and it\u2019s worth trying without it, then maybe enable it again just before the final render. It may sometimes be actually slower to render than standard rendering, but that depends on what you\u2019re rendering. You\u2019ll have to test with your own project if you suspect it to slow down your renders, but that shouldn\u2019t be the case in the majority of projects. In doubt, leave it enabled. Duik features impacting performance Some features in Duik are especially slowing down After Effects, it\u2019s best to know them and what you can do to improve performance with these specific features (or try to avoid them). Tip Always have a look in the effects of the layers: in the effects created by Duik, there may be some performance options to adjust the balance between performance and quality (especially the quality of motion blurs). Tip Some effects created by Duik have an option to adjust the precision of the motion blur. If you don\u2019t need motion blur on the layer, keep this to the lowest value, as it usually make the performance drop a lot. If you need motion blur, keep the value as low as possible to hide motion blur artifacts on fast movements. Tip Cut the layers when they\u2019re hidden or out of the frame of the composition to make sure the expressions aren\u2019t evaluated when they\u2019re not needed. Parent constraint The Parent constraint is a great tool but\u2026 It can be very computer-intensive. To be able to compute the location of a layer, it has to compute the previous movement of all its parents for all the previous frames of the composition. This means the longer the composition is, the slower it will be. Avoid using it in very long compositions, and try to use it only when necessary. Often, it is easier and quicker to just split the layer when its parent must change. The other constraint are much lighter, it\u2019s better to try to use the orientation or position constraint whenever possible instead of the parent constraint. IK The IK used in a character like the ones created by the Auto-rigger will not be a problem unless you have a lot of them, but there are a few tips to make them even lighter. When using shape layers as controllers, you can disable the guides on the controllers (the dashed lines representing the IK) in the effects of the controller. It\u2019s better to use raster controllers though (and in this case, there are no guides at all). When you deactivate the IK and animate in FK, the performance is usually better, and FK animation is actually easier than IK. Kleaner (simulated) Warning Beware of the simulation The default Kleaner automation should not be an issue most of the time. But beware of the simulation! As every simulations, it involves a lot more computation and can quickly become a reason why your rig won\u2019t work anymore. Try to use simulations as few as possible, and keep in mind that most of the time, animating hanging hairs or the antenna of a car is quick and easy with a few keyframes without even using the Kleaner. Simulation in the Kleaner happen only in multi-dimensional properties. You can completely disable simulations in the Performance section of the effect created by the Kleaner, as long as some other adjustment to further improve the performance according to your needs. Wheel (curved motion) The default Wheel automation is very light and won\u2019t be any problem. But be careful with the curved mode, as it needs to compute the trajectory of the wheel on all the previous frames of the composition. At the end of a long composition, this can be very heavy. Motion Trails As motion trails have to generate bezier paths according to the movement of layers, if you have a lot of layers and parenting, this can lead to very poor performance, as a lot of calculations are needed. You can\u2019t do much about it, except in some cases you can animate the trails by hand: copy the position keyframes into a bezier path, and use the \u201ctrim paths\u201d tool in a shape layer. If you don\u2019t need variable width on the motion trail, make sure to keep the mode to simple instead of advanced . The simple mode is much lighter. There are a few sampling option to adjust the balance between smoothness and performance. The Method should be kept on automatic, except if for some unknown reason it fails to generate a smooth path. Try to keep the number of samples as low as possible, on the lowest value you need for the trail to be smooth. Other automations and expressions added by Duik The other automations are not particularly heavy. Just be careful with automations like the Effector which is often used to drive a lot of layers together, which means it\u2019s a lot of expressions. Hardware What\u2019s the best hardware to use with After Effects? If you ask this question around, everyone will have a different opinion. Here\u2019s what we\u2019ve measured when developing Duik and other tools, and tested them on film productions. Disks There are three important locations for your data when working with After Effects: The system, where After Effects is installed. These files are mostly read when After Effects is launched, and then used just very little. The Disk Cache which stores the temporary rendered frames. This is the most used location. Your media files (footage). These files are read regularly to render your compositions. It doesn\u2019t really matter where you store the project files themselves ( *.aep ) as they\u2019re read/written only when loading and saving the files, and should not be very big files anyway. The best case scenario is to have at least three big different physical disks, as fast as possible (SSD), for each of the aforementioned locations, but if you can\u2019t afford it, you can perfectly use just two disks: A disk as fast as possible for both the system and the disk cache: the system files are not used so often, so it\u2019s fine to store the disk cache on the same disk. Another disk to store your footage, which may be read at the same time the disk cache is read and written, so that will improve the performance to separate the footage. Note that the speed of this second disk is a bit less important, as the footage are mostly read and not written: it\u2019s always faster to read than write, and they\u2019re used a bit less than the disk cache. Both disks need to be quite big: the system disk will store your operating system and all applications, and it\u2019s more comfortable to have a large disk cache. The disk storing your footage (and rendered files) needs to be able to store a potentially large amount of medias. It is not recommended to use a single disk, unless it\u2019s very fast (and big\u2026). Note Dividing a physical disk into several partitions does not improve performance, and may even slow things down. Memory (RAM) The more, the better. Simple. It\u2019s not the RAM which matters most, we\u2019ve been able to use After Effects correctly with computers with only 8 GB or even small laptops with 4 GB (just remember you need to restart After Effects regularly to free memory). This being said, although everything will work well with as few as 8 GB, more RAM will always be useful if you can afford it. With a lot of RAM (at least 32 GB) you may even be able to disable the After Effects Disk Cache if you\u2019d like, which may improve the performance, and protect your disks by limiting the number of write access to them. RAM Disk A RAM disk 7 is a block of random-access memory (RAM, i.e. volatile memory) that a computer\u2019s software is treating as if the memory were a disk drive (secondary storage). RAM disks provide high-performance temporary storage for demanding tasks and protect non-volatile storage devices from wearing down, since RAM is not prone to wear from writing, unlike non-volatile flash memory. The performance of a RAM disk is generally orders of magnitude faster than other forms of digital storage, such as SSD or hard disk. This performance gain is due to multiple factors, including access time, maximum throughput, and file system characteristics. With more than 32 or 64 GB, you could create a small Ram Disk to store temporary files or test projects which will be automatically erased when restarting the computer. This has proven very useful in our experience, even with RAM Disks as small as 2 GB. With at least 64 GB RAM, you could create a RAM Disk of a few dozens of gigabytes to be used as the After Effects Disk cache. In this case, you\u2019ll keep the cache between After Effects sessions, as long as you don\u2019t restart the computer, and it will be as fast as possible, while protecting your physical disks by limiting the number of write access to them. But to do that you\u2019ll need at least 64 GB of memory to keep enough standard RAM. Note The RAM Disk can be activated only when you need it, and deactivated when you need your full amount of RAM. Central Processing Unit (CPU) That\u2019s the most important part for After Effects: it is used a lot when working and rendering the compositions. The faster, the better. It seems that, given the choice, it\u2019s better to have less threads with a higher frequency than more slower threads (i.e. prefer GHz over Cores ). Note that the relation between the CPU capabilities and After Effects performance doesn\u2019t feel linear: a CPU twice faster will not result in After Effects being twice faster, but just a bit faster. Anyway, After Effects is always too slow, so if you plan to work in After Effects, try to spend your money mostly on the CPU. Graphical Processing Unit (GPU) After Effects does use the GPU more and more to render the effects and compositions, so it\u2019s a good idea to use a good GPU. Of course, if you\u2019re working with 3D, you\u2019ll need a high-end GPU anyway, but if you\u2019re only working with After Effects, 2D, and video, it\u2019s not useful to have the best GPU, a mid-level GPU is enough.

The series revolves around four boys\u2014Stan Marsh, Kyle Broflovski, Eric Cartman, and Kenny McCormick\u2014and their exploits in and around the titular Colorado town.

It is an essential tool to simplify the management of compositions with lots of layers, without any need to precompose! cf. rxlaboratory.org/tools/dugr \u21a9 \u21a9 \u21a9 Because there\u2019s no way to reliably store any data with expressions in After Effects, expressions depending on previous values of the same property (cumulating the values) actually have to re-compute everything for each frame of the composition. This means that for each frame, they need to add up all previous values. The total number of values to be computed for a given composition is a triangular number (see en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_number ) given by the formula (f\u00b2 + f) / 2 where f is the number of frames in the composition. Because of the f\u00b2 in the formula, this number grows very fast with the duration of the composition. \u21a9 Rafael Arame is a recognized After Effects rigging expert.

This means that the image displayed by the After Effects viewport is pixel-accurate. Its priority is image quality against performance; to the contrary of most animation applications, where you have to render the animation to get the final high-quality video, After Effects\u2019 goal is to let you work directly on the final image. After Effects is not a character rigging and animation application. Animating characters in After Effects is interesting though, thanks to it letting you work directly on the actual, rendered, animation. After Effects is very good at manipulating pixel assets (better than vectors), which makes it a decent software for cut-out character animation. These last two decades, a lot of third-party tools were built on top of these features, specifically made for character animation; Duik was the first in 2008, followed by others ( Rubberhose , Joystick and Sliders , etc.). Before that, there was no proper character rigging in After Effects, and it was fine. Duik and these other tools brought high-level rigging and animation to After Effects, and great films were made with this technique, but it also brought a lot of performance issues. The way a compositing application like After Effects works is not made for performance. It is important to always keep in mind what is going to slow down After Effects when animating characters and props, to be able to organize your projects in a way to limit these performance issues, and adjust the settings of your tools accordingly.","title":"How to improve After Effects and Duik performance"},{"location":"advanced/performance.html#choose-the-right-tool","text":"Honestly, if you\u2019re in some kind of very advanced rigging and animation project, if you\u2019re in top-level quality and need both performance and versatility, After Effects may not be the right choice. Did you know South Park 1 was made with Maya 2 ? Why don\u2019t you animate in Blender 3 with a nice rig? You can rig 2D characters in 3D software, and you won\u2019t have performance issues there. But let\u2019s agree that sometimes, it\u2019s easier and quicker to use less applications, to not have to render animations between different applications and to animate in the same software which will be used for compositing. In this case, Duik is the tool you need for character animation in After Effects. Note Some explanations here might not be perfectly accurate about how After Effects works (there are caching systems and other tricks to improve performance we won\u2019t explain here), but the point is to explain where to look at to improve performance.","title":"Choose the right tool"},{"location":"advanced/performance.html#summary","text":"Here\u2019s a checklist of what you can do to improve the performance in After Effects, from most to less important. Read the next sections for detailed explanations about these suggestions. Set the preview quality to Off (Final Quality) . Don\u2019t leave it to Adaptive Resolution . Lower the preview resolution if you can (to Half or Third ). Don\u2019t leave it to Auto . Hide, and shy, unneeded layers. Hide the layer controls ( Ctrl + Shift + H ). Cut/hide all layers as soon as they\u2019re outside of the frame of the composition. Render or precompose (with a proxy!) the Shape Layers. Always precompose layers before duplicating them, if what you need is an exact copy. Bake expressions whenever you can, remove or deactivate unnneeded expressions (the ones which don\u2019t actually animate anything). Precompose the animated characters and props, and render proxies for them before compositing. Don\u2019t use essential properties. Use image sequences; Render to openEXR instead than PNG . Avoid the puppet tool. Restart After Effects every hour. Keep the After Effects project as small as possible. Some tools are more compute-intensive than others. You have to know which ones to avoid or to optimize to fix performance issues in your rigs. You must know that Duik only uses native After Effects features, it automates things you could do by yourself (provided you have a lot of time to spend at it). This means it is not Duik by itself which causes performance issues, it is how native After Effects features are used together and how many of them at the same time. Next is a non-exhaustive list of features you have to be careful with.","title":"Summary"},{"location":"advanced/performance.html#preview-quantity-and-quality","text":"This is not what will improve performance the most, but it\u2019s measures you can take without making any compromise on the features of your rig. When animating, you can downgrade the quality of the preview, and the quantity of layers displayed. Do you really need to display the Bones and Pins ? Do Bones and Controllers really need anti-aliasing, or could they be set to draft mode? Actually, do controllers need to be shape layers or could they be simple nulls? Do all layers have to be vectors or could they be pre-rendered to an image format? These are the kind of questions you have to ask yourself. There are a few options to speed up the preview and your workflow in After Effects. You can set the overall quality of the preview. The default option, Adaptive Resolution , does not seem to be the best choice, as constantly changing the resolution of the preview when moving layers does not feel fluid at all. Off (Final Quality) does feel way more fluid when working, as does Fast Draft . There\u2019s actually not much difference between Fast Draft and Off (Final Quality) \u2026 You can change the resolution of the preview. Again, the default one, Auto may not be the best for fluidity if you have this habit a lot of people have to constantly zoom in and out, to work details and have an overall look at the image, and if you don\u2019t always do RAM previews at the same level of zoom. In this case, After Effects will be constantly rendering the preview at different resolutions and this has a very bad impact on performance and fluidity. It may be best to wisely choose a resolution and stick to it. Most of the time, when animating in HD or 2K compositions (or bigger), Half resolution or even Third is enough. You can change the quality of the preview per layer too. In the attributes of the layer, clicking this icon will disable anti-aliasing and other algorithms which are not needed for animation, and this may improve performance a bit. Do the controllers really need the best quality? The quantity of layers enabled greatly impacts the performance of the user interface. Solo and shy the layers as much as possible, hide anything not needed. For this workflow, our other free tool DuGR 4 can be a great help, and it is fully compatible with Duik. Read below for more information about it.","title":"Preview quantity and quality"},{"location":"advanced/performance.html#layers","text":"The type of layers you use is of great importance to improve the performance. This table lists them from worst to best in terms of performance. Type Notes Complex Shape Layers Shape layers with a lot of content or many expressions are the worst. Simple Shape Layers Very simple shape layers, with just a few shapes and without heavy expressions are much better, but are still a bit slower than raster layer to render. Raster Layers Raster layers (pixels, a.k.a. bitmaps) just need to be displayed, there\u2019s nothing to compute (except effects of course). Null Layers As they\u2019re empty, their impact on performance is negligible. Simple Shape Layers, controls hidden When hiding layer controls ( Ctrl + Shift + H ), the performance is much better, for all types of layers, except complex shapes. Raster Layers, controls hidden Null Layers, controls hidden As Null layers consist only of layer controls, hiding the layer controls means they don\u2019t have any impact on the performance (except for parenting and expressions in the transform properties) As you can see in this table, there are two ways to improve the performance of the viewport and the rendering performance in After Effects: Always hide the layer controls . This is by far the best way to improve performance in After Effects when manipulating layers. The option is available in the View \u25b6 View Options... menu in After Effects, and they can be quickly toggled with the Ctrl + Shift + H shortcut. You may have to do this quite regularly as its a pre-composition option. Always prefer raster layers . A raster layer will almost always be faster to render than a shape layer. If you don\u2019t need to animate the contents of a shape layer, you could precompose it, or, even better, render it to an openEXR file and replace the shape with the rendered image. Tip It seems the performance is a bit better (approximately 10 %) with a shape layer containing many shapes than with everything exploded in several layers.","title":"Layers"},{"location":"advanced/performance.html#cuthide-invisible-layers","text":"Quite often, when animating some layers position, they may be (temporarily) outside of the frame of the composition. In this case, performance may be improved if you hide/cut them as soon as they get out, to be sure to prevent any rendering and evaluation of the expressions which are not needed as long as the layer can\u2019t be seen. This is also true if for some time a layer is hidden beneath other layers, cutting it may improve performance.","title":"Cut/hide invisible layers"},{"location":"advanced/performance.html#render-the-shape-layers","text":"Every time you use a b\u00e9zier shape, After Effects has to rasterize it before it can display it and render the composition. This means the more shape layers you have, the lower the performance will be. Whenever it\u2019s possible, you should precompose the shape layer, to the smallest composition you can: this way the precomposition is a raster layer, a bitmap with actual pixels, and faster to render. You can even render this precomposition to an image sequence to replace it or use it as a proxy. Proxies are great! Of course, do not check the continuous rasterization option on the precomposition layer or you\u2019ll lose all benefits of the precomposition. Read the Precompositions section below for more information. Tip A shape layer without animation nor expressions in its content should always be replaced by an image. Especially when using the puppet tool! As it works with the rendered pixels and not with the vector data, you won\u2019t lose quality, there\u2019s no need to keep the vectors. And precomposing the shape will fix a lot of issues\u2026 Tip Even if the shape layer uses expressions in its content, it can be a good idea to precompose it. This way, you could temporarily freeze time on the precomposition layer to disable all expressions inside and improve the performance when animating, and only remove the time remapping to adjust details and render the final animation. You could also render a proxy of the precomposition to keep the final result while animating other parts. It is NOT a good idea to use shapes hoping to be able to scale them. It will have a bad impact on performance, scaling is another step in the render process which takes some time. Especially if you have a lot of shape layers. Scaling rigs is very complicated as it will probably break a lot of expressions. Before working your animation, you should always draw a storyboard; this way you know which sizes are needed for your character and you can build a different rig for each. When you see only a close up on the torso and the head, do you really need the rig of the legs? When the character is far away, do you really need complex facial expressions? Will you even draw the character the same way? If you\u2019re using vectors only for scaling purposes, you can rasterize them (at a higher resolution if really needed) and greatly improve performance.","title":"Render the Shape Layers"},{"location":"advanced/performance.html#duik-bones","text":"Duik Bones are Shape Layers and thus have a bad impact on performance. This is not a big issue though, as they\u2019re not meant to be displayed; when hidden, their performance impact is negligible, especially if they\u2019re baked . This being said, with all their envelops and noodles , they quickly become complicated to manipulate. If you don\u2019t need these advanced features, you have the option to use simpler bones, displayed as small dots, which are much lighter. Even when using these simpler bones, there are still a few expressions to control their appearance. To further improve performance, you can bake the bones to remove these expressions. By default, the bones are automatically baked when running the auto-rig. \u25b7 Read the Bones and Autorig section for more information about these options.","title":"Duik Bones"},{"location":"advanced/performance.html#duik-controllers","text":"By default, Duik uses Shape Layers for controllers too. This enables the dynamic display of some guides and helpers directly inside the controller layer contents, but, again, this has a bad impact on performance. If you don\u2019t need these guides, there are two ways to avoid using shape layers as controllers: Use raster layers ( PNG images imported into the project, or custom layers you\u2019ve created). In this case, you can still use a nice icon to identify the controllers, and you can hide the layer controls ( Ctrl + Shift + H ) to achieve the best performance. If you\u2019d like to customize the appearance of the controllers, like you would do with shape layers, you can use some simple effects, like the transform effect to move and scale the icon, and the fill effect to change its color. Even with these effects, the performance is better than shape layers. Use null layers . Null layers have a great performance, but they\u2019re completely invisible if you hide layer controls, and can\u2019t be customized as nicely as standard layers. It\u2019s nice that they\u2019re automatically hidden when previewing an animation though. When using raster layers or null layers as controllers, the performance of the rig is much better; but if you still want or need to use shape layers, you can also bake their appearance to make things a bit better. Shape layer controllers are automatically baked by default when extracting controllers from a precomposed rig. \u25b7 Read the Controllers section for more information about these options.","title":"Duik Controllers"},{"location":"advanced/performance.html#expressions","text":"Expressions in After Effects are all evaluated (computed) when rendering each frame of the composition . This won\u2019t be an issue if they are simple, with basic calculations like the vast majority of expressions you may write by yourself. Now, imagine an expression, which, when it is evaluated (i.e. at each frame of the composition), needs to compute previous movements of some other layers - this is what simulations do. This means it also needs to compute everything which influences the layers in previous frames of the composition, including other expressions, which might be complex too\u2026 This is a nasty situation where performance will drop dramatically 5 . Some features of Duik use very complex expressions , and compute-intensive calculations, like the IK which involves more maths than simple additions and multiplications, or simulations like the kleaner\u2019s follow-through which have to compute previous movements. Even if we\u2019ve been hard at work to fix performance issues, in some cases combining a lot of expressions (i.e. Duik features) can lead to poorer performance when animating, or even so much lag that the rig cannot be correctly manipulated anymore. Note Don\u2019t worry about simple expressions you create manually, like links between properties, or simple wiggles, etc. They\u2019re not a problem, even if you have hundreds of them. When dealing with complex expressions, just remember that the more expressions = the more performance issues you\u2019ll have. In the end, expressions are just animations and could be replaced by keyframes to improve the performance. After Effects can bake the expressions to keyframes for you, with the Animation \u25b6 Keyframe Assistant \u25b6 Convert Expression to Keyframes menu entry. This creates one keyframe per frame, then deactivates the expression. Duik can also help you with that: the bake expression tool in the Automation and expressions panel has two better ways to convert expressions to keyframes: A smart mode creates an animation as close as possible to the result of the expression, using just a few B\u00e9zier keyframes, and keeps the animation easy to edit later. A precise mode creates an animation with as much keyframes as needed for a perfect match (which is still less than the After Effects native tool).","title":"Expressions"},{"location":"advanced/performance.html#bezier-paths-and-expressions","text":"For some reason, using an expression to control the B\u00e9zier path of a mask is much slower than the same expression in a shape layer : if you need to use expressions with B\u00e9zier path, try to always use shape layers instead of masks!

The number of layers displayed in the timeline influences a lot the performance of the user interface. There are two ways to improve that: Use the Shy Mode to reduce the number of displayed layers.

Precomposing several layers reduces the number of layers displayed in the timeline and improves the performance of the user interface, and, used wisely, precompositions can greatly improve the rendering performance. Each time you duplicate a layer, you have to ask yourself if you can precompose it first in any way and then duplicate the precomposition. Very often, you can precompose! Tip Keep in mind that you can use expressions to link stuff from the precomposition to the main composition. With the Parent across compositions tool of Duik, you can even parent a layer in a precomposition to a layer outside of it. The Extract Controllers tool can be of great help too. When you precompose before duplicating the layer(s), all its transformation and effects will be rendered only once and only then they will be duplicated. Without precomposition, everything has to be rendered twice (or more if you duplicate again the same layer).

This also means it gets much more complicated to use proxies with these compositions\u2026 Essential properties also have a lower performance than simple expression links; to control a property inside a precomposition, an expression will always be better.

If you\u2019ve understood what we wrote just above, you may be beginning to use more image formats and less shapes, whether it\u2019s for proxies or final render. What formats should be used? When rendering animations, most of the time it\u2019s better and easier to use image sequences than video files. There is at least one very good and simple reason for it: if the render fails, you won\u2019t have to start it all again, but just the remaining frames. If you want to change something in the animation, you will only have to render the corresponding frames. You should use a format which suits your needs (color depth, alpha channel), but also a format which is fast to read and write by After Effects! Our advice is to use OpenEXR (with PIZ (lossless) or DWA (slightly lossy) compression) which handles 32bpc, and has an alpha channel. It is also way faster to read/write than PNG in After Effects, and files are usually smaller with EXR . It\u2019s better than the RAW format of your camera, it\u2019s great for storing HDRi. Premiere and other editing software, as well as Photoshop, can read them; as specified in the name, they\u2019re open and widely compatible. What more could you ask for? Tip You can render the audio to a simple *.wav file stored next to the image sequence. If you still prefer using video files, you should choose a format which is also as fast as possible to read and write. Avoid H.264 and H.265 ( mp4 , etc.) and prefer intra-frame codecs like Apple ProRes , Avid DnxHD , or Quicktime Animation . Note that, although it\u2019s widely used, ProRes (and DnxHD / DnxHR ) is a lossy codec which outputs huge files.

There\u2019s nothing we can do about that, and it\u2019s one of the main reason why you should learn animation in another application (like Blender) if you can. This problem has another less-known implication: scripts are (very) slow. In After Effects, scripts run in the same thread as the user interface. This itself could be seen as a design flaw, although at the time this was designed, multi-threading was not the thing it is today. But the real problem is that when a script is running, there\u2019s no way to stop the user interface to try to follow. Each operation a script does, the user interface tries to reflect it. And the script has to wait for the user interface to finish this (slow) operation to continue onto its next step (because it lives in the same thread). Although the actual operation the script does could be very fast, it is slowed down by the user interface of After Effects. For example, a script creating a few dozens of new keyframes on some properties will be slowed down for each keyframe creation by the user interface actually showing the new keyframe (instead of waiting for the script to finish and draw them all at once).

Display \u25b6 Motion Path : Displaying too long motion paths can be very laggy, especially if the motion path is the result of complex expressions. Be careful with that; it may be better to deactivate completely the motion paths and enable them only when needed. Unfortunately, there\u2019s no shortcut for that, but Duik may include a button for that in the future. Display \u25b6 Disable Thumbnails in Project Panel : This option doesn\u2019t really improve the performance, but again, sometimes with very big projects, every little improvement helps. Media & Disk Cache \u25b6 Disk Cache : When the disk cache is enabled, After Effects will save rendered frames to a temporary location on a specified disk. This is needed if your system runs with low RAM memory. If you have a lot of available memory (more that 32 or even 64GB) when working with After Effects, it may improve performance to disable the disk cache: in this case, After Effects saves the frames only into RAM, which is much faster than any disk. But in this case, you\u2019ll lose all the cache when closing After Effects or restarting your computer, to the contrary of the disk cache. A way to benefit from both worlds is to create a Ram Disk , read below for more information. No matter what, you should always choose a location on the fastest (SSD) possible disk on your system, separate from the disk containing your footage if possible. Memory & Performance \u25b6 Memory : Be careful with this option: due to the memory leaks explained in the previous section, the memory limit is not actually respected! It is easy to show that After Effects memory can be much higher than the limit set here, by just running a complex script (like Duik) a few times. Memory & Performance \u25b6 Performance : Using Multi-Frame Rendering usually improves performance, but in specific cases it may be better to deactivate this option: if you work with complex compositions, lots of expressions, or non-compatible effects, multi-frame rendering may actually slow down the rendering process: It takes more time to start the rendering process when using multi-frame rendering. This can be a problem for previews: if you notice a long delay between requesting the preview and the render of the first frame, it may be because of multi-frame rendering and it\u2019s worth trying without it, then maybe enable it again just before the final render. It may sometimes be actually slower to render than standard rendering, but that depends on what you\u2019re rendering. You\u2019ll have to test with your own project if you suspect it to slow down your renders, but that shouldn\u2019t be the case in the majority of projects. In doubt, leave it enabled.","title":"Preferences"},{"location":"advanced/performance.html#duik-features-impacting-performance","text":"Some features in Duik are especially slowing down After Effects, it\u2019s best to know them and what you can do to improve performance with these specific features (or try to avoid them). Tip Always have a look in the effects of the layers: in the effects created by Duik, there may be some performance options to adjust the balance between performance and quality (especially the quality of motion blurs). Tip Some effects created by Duik have an option to adjust the precision of the motion blur. If you don\u2019t need motion blur on the layer, keep this to the lowest value, as it usually make the performance drop a lot. If you need motion blur, keep the value as low as possible to hide motion blur artifacts on fast movements.

These files are mostly read when After Effects is launched, and then used just very little. The Disk Cache which stores the temporary rendered frames. This is the most used location. Your media files (footage). These files are read regularly to render your compositions. It doesn\u2019t really matter where you store the project files themselves ( *.aep ) as they\u2019re read/written only when loading and saving the files, and should not be very big files anyway. The best case scenario is to have at least three big different physical disks, as fast as possible (SSD), for each of the aforementioned locations, but if you can\u2019t afford it, you can perfectly use just two disks: A disk as fast as possible for both the system and the disk cache: the system files are not used so often, so it\u2019s fine to store the disk cache on the same disk. Another disk to store your footage, which may be read at the same time the disk cache is read and written, so that will improve the performance to separate the footage. Note that the speed of this second disk is a bit less important, as the footage are mostly read and not written: it\u2019s always faster to read than write, and they\u2019re used a bit less than the disk cache. Both disks need to be quite big: the system disk will store your operating system and all applications, and it\u2019s more comfortable to have a large disk cache. The disk storing your footage (and rendered files) needs to be able to store a potentially large amount of medias. It is not recommended to use a single disk, unless it\u2019s very fast (and big\u2026).

This being said, although everything will work well with as few as 8 GB, more RAM will always be useful if you can afford it. With a lot of RAM (at least 32 GB) you may even be able to disable the After Effects Disk Cache if you\u2019d like, which may improve the performance, and protect your disks by limiting the number of write access to them.","title":"Memory (RAM)"},{"location":"advanced/performance.html#ram-disk","text":"A RAM disk 7 is a block of random-access memory (RAM, i.e. volatile memory) that a computer\u2019s software is treating as if the memory were a disk drive (secondary storage). RAM disks provide high-performance temporary storage for demanding tasks and protect non-volatile storage devices from wearing down, since RAM is not prone to wear from writing, unlike non-volatile flash memory. The performance of a RAM disk is generally orders of magnitude faster than other forms of digital storage, such as SSD or hard disk. This performance gain is due to multiple factors, including access time, maximum throughput, and file system characteristics. With more than 32 or 64 GB, you could create a small Ram Disk to store temporary files or test projects which will be automatically erased when restarting the computer. This has proven very useful in our experience, even with RAM Disks as small as 2 GB. With at least 64 GB RAM, you could create a RAM Disk of a few dozens of gigabytes to be used as the After Effects Disk cache. In this case, you\u2019ll keep the cache between After Effects sessions, as long as you don\u2019t restart the computer, and it will be as fast as possible, while protecting your physical disks by limiting the number of write access to them.

Note that the relation between the CPU capabilities and After Effects performance doesn\u2019t feel linear: a CPU twice faster will not result in After Effects being twice faster, but just a bit faster.

Most of theses features are simple methods, sorted in a few namespaces to keep things tidy. For example, to run the arm auto-rig, just run the arm method from the Rig namespace of Duik : // Automatically rig the selected bones as an arm Duik.Rig.arm(); // Or you can pass an array of layers to the rigging methods Duik.Rig.leg( someLayers ); As another example, you can also add a wiggle effect to the selected properties, or some properties of your choice. The wiggle method is in the Automation namespace of Duik : // Add a Wiggle control with default options to the selected properties Duik.Automation.wiggle(); // Or you can set some parameters // 1. Separate dimensions // 2. Add one control per property (instead of a single control for all of them) // 3. An array of properties to setup Duik.Automation.wiggle( true, true, someProperties ); Of course, all these methods are fully documented; you can read the reference of the Duik namespace to learn all of them. This Duik namespace is divided in a few other categories to make things easier to find and use: Duik.Animation : The animator\u2019s toolkit (copy/paste animation, tween, snapKeys\u2026) Duik.Automation : The lazy animator\u2019s toolkit. (NLA, motionTrail, wiggle, random, walk cycle\u2026) Duik.Bone : Bone and armatures related tools. (leg, arm, bake\u2026) Duik.Camera : Camera toolkit. (frame, rig, twoDCamera\u2026) Duik.CmdLib : The Duik command line library. This is a specific namespace used by the Duik Command Line panel. Duik.Constraint : Constraints for rigging bones and layers. (twoLayerIK, oneLayerIK, bezierIK, orientation, parentAcrosscomp\u2026) Duik.Controller : Controller related tools. (create, bake\u2026) Duik.Layer : Layer related tools. (setLimbName, setCharacterName, select, sanitizeName\u2026) Duik.Pin : Pin related tools. (create, linkPathToLayers, linkPuppetPinsToLayers, addPins\u2026) Duik.Rig : (Auto)Rigging tools. (auto, arm, leg, fin, wing\u2026) Duik.Tool : Miscellaneous tools. (cropPrecompositions, editExpression\u2026) DuAEF, After Effects Framework DuAEF includes a lot of useful methods to help After Effects Scripting, and a few specific objects. They\u2019re all objects and namespaces which name start with DuAE . Example: // Get the active composition var comp = DuAEProject.getActiveComp(); // May be null if there's no active comp. if (comp) { // Add a 20 px wide null layer // Note that DuAEF uses a shape layer as null layer, // so it doesn't pollute the \"Solids\" folder of the project. var null = DuAEComp.addNull( comp, 20 ); } Some objects are available to make things easier. Especially with properties (to work around the dreaded invalid object from AE\u2019s strange behavior). var comp = DuAEProject.getActiveComp(); var layer = comp.layer(1); var transform = new DuAEProperty( layer.transform ) // Replaces some text in all expressions of all properties in the \"transform\" PropertyGroup transform.replaceInExpressions(\"before\", \"after\"); // We can also select all keyframes for example transform.selectKeys(); // Or change the interpolation for all keyframes transform.setInterpolation( KeyframeInterpolationType.BEZIER ); Note In the future, namespaces like DuAEComp may be also available as wrappers, objects, like DuAEProperty . DuESF, ExtendScript Framework DuESF extends the default ExtendScript framework with useful objects and methods. For example, a set is available to ease the creation of UIs. // This will be our main panel var ui = DuScriptUI.scriptPanel( thisObj, true, true, new File($.fileName) ); ui.addCommonSettings(); // Automatically adds the language settings, location of the settings file, etc DuScriptUI.staticText( ui.settingsGroup, \"Hello world of settings!\" ); // Adds a static text to the settings panel DuScriptUI.staticText( ui.mainGroup, \"Hello worlds!\" ); // Adds a static text to the main panel DuScriptUI.button( ui.mainGroup, \"A Button\"); // Adds a button, which can have an icon // When you're ready to display everything DuScriptUI.showUI(ui); It also includes a lot of lower level objects and methods. Here are some examples. // COLORS var red = new DuColor([1, 0, 0, 1]); // alerts \"#ff0000\" alert(red.hex); // Get a darker red var darkerRed = red.darker(); // You can also create a color from hex var blue = DuColor.fromHex(\"#0000ff\"); // Or use a predefined color var aeBlue = DuColor.Color.AFTER_EFFECTS_BLUE; // MATH // Clamp a value (works also with a set of values) var clamped = DuMath.clamp( aValue, -5, 5); // Linear interpolation (or extrapolation) var interpolation = DuMath.linear( aValue, 0, 1, 12, 27); // Some useful functions are available var gauss = DuMath.gaussian( aValue ); var randomValue = DuMath.gaussRandom( 0, 10 ); // FILES // Get the first line of a text file var info = DuFile.readFirstLine( \"C:/a/path/file.txt\" ); // Save a JS object to a JSON file var obj = { one: \"A text\", two: [ \"an\", \"array\"] }; DuFile.saveJSON(obj, \"C:/a/path/file.json\" );","title":"Getting Started"},{"location":"advanced/api/getting-started.html#getting-started","text":"","title":"Getting started"},{"location":"advanced/api/getting-started.html#download-the-api","text":"The API and its documentation can be downloaded from RxLaboratory , or from a dedicated Github Repository .","title":"Download the API"},{"location":"advanced/api/getting-started.html#include-it-in-your-script","text":"The Duik API comes in a few files: Duik_api.jsxinc is the complete API, including all dependencies.

Be annoying, be angry, be upset. Always create for the benefit of the people the instruments of their well-being, and you will have created the instruments of their power and emancipation. Jean-Baptiste Andr\u00e9 Godin When I started to develop my own software to help my own work in animation, it was just my own tools and nothing else. It was private and made my life better, it had no impact at all on other people\u2019s life. Well, to be honest, as I wasn\u2019t working alone, it quickly had a small impact on my colleagues, easing their processes too. And then, I decided I could share those tools with the rest of the world, if the rest of the world was interested. And it was. The most well known of my tools, Duik, is now downloaded 1000 times a day. Going from private to public made these tools political. I had to choose how they were going to impact other people\u2019s life. Everything is about choices What was I going to do? I had a new product, I could just sell it like almost everything else in our capitalist society, or even better, I could rent it to keep my customers as hostages. But I had a unique occasion to think about my own impact on the world. There are a lot of things I don\u2019t like in our society: individualism, consumerism, competition\u2026 Everything is connected, intertwined. Because our society is capitalist, it makes people individualist competitors and consumers. It\u2019s how things go. The question is: what will happen if we get really conscious of this? What will happen if we follow other paths? I chose to do things in a less common way, maybe even a rare way: I chose to give away my tools. I chose not to earn money with them, or at least, I chose to let people choose if it was worth paying for . I chose freedom, for myself, and for the rest of the world. I chose to let my tools open source, I chose to let people get, use, and modify them freely, instead of being worried of thieves and pirates. I chose to make my stuff available even for the poorest human being on earth. Because I think my choices can have an impact. Because I think that if I work outside of and against capitalism and consumerism, if I show a different path, the path may be followed , and maybe, maybe it\u2019s a step to what I think is a better world. Politics, that\u2019s just politics. One is ready to accept a lot of compromises 1 to be able to consume the easy way. But if one\u2019s been given the choice either to consume freely, or to donate time or money, one just consumes and nothing else. It\u2019s too easy to just download and use if it\u2019s \u201cfree\u201d, so much easier than making a donation first, or to contribute in any way. It would have been easy to sell my tools. It would have been easy not to give any choice to the users. But I chose a difficult path . I know that most people won\u2019t understand it, but I don\u2019t regret my choice , and I would do it again - even if I know I could be richer than I could ever have imagined - because it\u2019s more important for me to show that another world is possible, where people are free from property , where economy is subordinated to the well-being of all , where happiness comes from equality of all the people. This better world already exists and just needs to be extended, that\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to show; you just have to join us. Consume less, share better. Herv\u00e9 Kempf Numbers Duik is a big success. Millions of downloads so far, an average of 1000 downloads per day , thousands of daily users. It\u2019s a big success, with very few supporters. 250 backers during each of the crowd-funding campaigns, and 300 monthly or annual subscribers 2 (and these groups are overlapping, we can\u2019t even add the numbers). It\u2019s a big success, with even fewer contributors. There are less than 10 meaningful contributors (to the code, the translations, the documentation\u2026). It\u2019s a big success, without earning even a single full-time salary in the country where it\u2019s developed (France). We estimate less than 4 % of our daily users did contribute time or money to the project. It works, thanks to other ways of earning the missing money (selling tutorials and books for example). But imagine what we could do if more people contributed! If, for each download, we got a single US dollar, we would\u2019ve got millions to improve the world together! Despite the fact that Duik is useful to - and needed by - the society, there\u2019s no reward and it stays very hard to develop and maintain. Because in our capitalist world, we don\u2019t reward what\u2019s useful or needed; products are valued based on an abstract market value . Products have to be sold to be valued. That\u2019s how capitalism and mercantilism work, hand in hand. Property is the Right of Increase claimed by the Proprietor over any thing which he has stamped as his own. Pierre-Joseph Proudhon Consume less and contribute more I\u2019m not upset, I\u2019m not discouraged. On the contrary, because I did things differently, I thought differently, I achieved something different. Obviously, I don\u2019t do what I do for money \u2013 but unfortunately money is a need. Why so many efforts? Because I chose not to be only a consumer , but I wanted to be a contributor . I don\u2019t want to consume life, I want to contribute to the society, because I\u2019m the product of society and I have a great debt to it. Even the most wretched individual of our present society could not exist and develop without the cumulative social efforts of countless generations. Thus the individual, his freedom and reason, are the products of society, and not vice versa: society is not the product of individuals comprising it; and the higher, the more fully the individual is developed, the greater his freedom \u2014 and the more he is the product of society, the more does he receive from society and the greater his debt to it. Mikhail Bakunin I\u2019m not waiting for someone to sell me what I need, I try to build what I need and then share it, before someone else sells it . I want to be able to explain what I did to the society, and be proud of it. Selling my software would not have been a contribution to society, even if it\u2019s needed and successful, because it would not have pulled our community to what I think would be the right direction. It would only give me the sensation I did something which matters, but it would not have been really useful for the community. It\u2019s not enough to make useful things, what\u2019s important is what we do with them, how we make them , how we share them . This is my point of view, and it matters . It matters that I have a point of view , it matters that I say it out loud. It matters that creating free software is a political gesture for me, because this means I\u2019m contributing to the community , because it means I asked myself enough questions about what I was doing and how it would impact others. It\u2019s an effort, it\u2019s harder than being a simple consumer, it\u2019s less rewarding in the short term, but way more in the long run, because I can be proud. Not rich, but legitimately proud. What I want you to know, is that it\u2019s actually not so hard. Join us! Of course I had the luck of being able to do it, I had the luck to be born where I was born, to have had a little spare time at some point in my life, to have had a good education\u2026 But it\u2019s not just luck, it\u2019s also choices. Political choices , ethic choices. Everyone can ask questions, everyone can be angry at things, everyone can think about individualism and consumerism.

I just hope you\u2019ll think about it now, that\u2019s what I\u2019m asking. Do things in a way they matter and think about how they matter. Do what you can, no less, no more. We\u2019re enough people in the world to make the society change . There are a lot of concrete ways to contribute more and consume less, even without being a specialist. Most of all, think about what you\u2019re doing and how you can do it in a way that matters . Be political. Make choices . Don\u2019t let the system make your choices before you do. Everything you do deserves that you ask yourself: \u201cHow can I do this or that in a better way? Is there an alternative to consuming this product or this service?\u201d.

This means all it does is automating things. It does nothing you could not do manually by yourself in After Effects (if you had time to do some very tedious work). This has two important meanings: A project rigged or animated with Duik can be opened with any instance of After Effects even if Duik is not installed. Duik uses only tools and techniques already existing in After Effects . Principles, User Interface and User Experience The goal of a tool like Duik is to make the life of animators and riggers easier. The priority was to make Duik as easy to learn as possible , while keeping it very quick to use . The other important goal was to make the interface as small as possible, so it won\u2019t take much space in the After Effects interface; we think it\u2019s very important to be able to focus on the timeline and the viewport of the application, without any other tools distracting you when you\u2019re animating. To achieve this, we\u2019ve made Duik smarter. Almost all tools can be used in a single click , without any prior configuration steps, letting Duik make the best choice depending on what you\u2019re doing, what are the selected layers, etc. Most of the character rigging process can be reduced to two clicks in Duik \u00c1ngela ! First click: create some Armatures and bones . Second click: Auto-rig the whole Armature . If you feel this is not enough, a nice procedural walk and run cycle is just another click away\u2026 User Interface (UI) As any modern script in After Effects , Duik has the form of a panel which can be docked with other native After Effects panels and third party tools (provided it was correctly installed and launched from the Window menu of After Effects ). The User Interface has been designed with these main ideas in mind: Keep it close to the form of the user interface of After Effects Using controls similar to the native controls of After Effects helps the user get started quicker. But it was not possible, for specific features and for performance and stability reasons, to make everything exactly the same as in After Effects and controls differ a bit. The idea is that Duik must not stand out too much when docked with other After Effects panels. Do not use windows and dialogs With very rare exceptions, everything Duik needs to display will be displayed in its main panel, it won\u2019t use dialogs and other windows, so you know where to find information, and you\u2019re not distracted by pop-ups. Also, there are no blocking windows (what\u2019s called Modal Dialogs ), to keep an agile workflow. Keep the UI as small as possible What is important when working with graphics is the viewport. Duik is as small as it can be so it won\u2019t interfere with your workspace. Duik welcomes you with this home panel, from where you can quickly access all the features. The top bar shows the main categories (read below). The central panel is used to display the tools, knobs and buttons of the tools, and the bottom bar includes secondary options and features. Tip This home screen can be de-activated to get to the latest used panel as soon as Duik is launched, but this greatly increases its launch time. Categorization Duik is a comprehensive tool set for rigging and animation. This means there are a lot of tools available, but they are categorized in some useful panels, depending on what you\u2019re doing (animating, rigging, using cameras, etc.) These categories are always available on the top bar. Each panel can be displayed by clicking on one of these top buttons. Bones Links and constraints Controllers Automation & expressions Animation Camera Tools Command Line and Feature Library The button on the right hand side opens a simple note editor .

Help : opens the online help (this documentation you\u2019re reading), kept up-to-date. Individual panels As Duik is made of a lot of panels and sub-panels, depending on your workflow, sometimes you may lose time constantly switching from one panel to another, or just finding a tool you\u2019re not used to. As there are as many workflows as users, to address this issue Duik now comes with a lot of optional, individual and dockable panels , which you can use as stand-alone scripts. This is a great way to organize your workspace and keep several different panels of Duik opened at once. When these stand-alone panels are installed, you can also quickly open them by [Alt] + [Click] on the tab buttons in the Duik \u00c1ngela main panel. Tip Don\u2019t forget the stacked mode for After Effects panels, which can be nice to keep all your Duik panels at hand. Warning The more you open different script panels, the more memory leaks from After Effects. This can lead to very poor performance of the user interface of After Effects and of all script panels. Until this issue has been fixed by Adobe, try to limit the number of script panels you open during a working session, and/or restart After Effects regularly 4 . User Experience (UX) For every feature in Duik, the goal is to have a consistent workflow, the fastest possible, the easiest possible. Most of the tools work this way: Select layers, properties or keyframes in the timeline of After Effects Click. Click on the button of the tool you need For some tools, a secondary panel is displayed to ask for some additional needed information Watch Duik work (Actually, you won\u2019t, as for performance reasons most of the work remains hidden from the user, sorry ;) ) To be able to work in a single click, the tools need to be smart enough to take some decisions depending on what you\u2019re doing. Of course, Duik does not want you to be or feel limited to what you can do. Although most of the tools work in a single click, some of them are accompanied with a small button. This means there are options you can change for the future use of the tool, which you can access by clicking on it. Duik can also be personalized through some settings so you can adapt it to your liking. If you need help about any of the tools, keep your mouse cursor above the corresponding button: very often more details are explained in the tooltip which is shown a couple of seconds later. As you can read in the tooltip, when options are available for a specific tool, you can also [Shift] + [Click] to access them. UI Modes The User Interface can be adapted depending on the level of the user, to make it easier to use for beginners, while quicker and smaller for the most advanced users. Rookie, Standard and Expert modes shown in different panels. This UI mode can be changed through the settings . What Duik does in After Effects The After Effects features mainly used by Duik are: Expressions and parenting Layer creation Custom (Pseudo) effects Expressions Every time Duik adds an expression to a property, the expression begins with a comment to let you know what the expression is and does. Layers Although Duik uses existing layer types in After Effects (mostly shape layers and null objects), the layers it creates have a specific use and can be considered as new layer types. Layers created by Duik have a marker at their beginning, showing how Duik uses them (their \u201cDuik Type\u201d), and containing important data that Duik needs to work with. Do not remove these markers (but you can move them away, even before the beginning of the comp to hide them, if you find them annoying). These markers can also be used to store and show other useful information, like the location of the limb, or the groups 5 the layer is assigned to. Pseudo effects The pseudo effect used by the Wiggle tool. Duik uses a lot of pseudo effects. Pseudo-Effects are a hack to create nicer controls for expressions than the native After Effects \u201cExpression controls\u201d effects, but they do nothing more than controlling expressions too. It\u2019s a bit complicated to create them by hand in After Effects, but there are useful scripts which do this very easily like Pseudo Effect Maker 6 . Duik makes a great use of them to create nice user-friendly controls in the effects of the controllers. Always have a look in the Effects panel of After Effects when you rig or animate something with Duik! Removing Duik \u201ceffects\u201d When you need to remove something made by Duik, you have to understand that Duik did nothing more than creating layers, expressions and pseudo effects. Each time you need to remove something, you just have to remove the expressions and pseudo effects created by Duik, and maybe the layers too. This can sometimes be a bit tedious, but future versions of Duik will include tools to automate this process. Tip If you remove the pseudo effect first, the expressions will be in error. That makes it easier to locate and remove them!

It\u2019s also useful for professional compositors and more generally for all people having enough experience with After Effects. Although its goal is to ease the rigging and animation process and it comes with a lot of automated tools, it always lets you customize the way it works and gives you access to all low-level tools used within higher level features like auto-rigs. That means you can do anything you\u2019d like with Duik, as it is very comprehensive. You\u2019re not limited to the use of automatic processes and auto-rigs . Most of the tools are very similar to what you can find in any advanced rigged character animation software, mostly in 3D, like Blender , Maxon Cinema 4D or Autodesk Maya . A skilled 3D rigger will quickly learn how to use Duik. A beginner learning Duik will know also the basics of 3D rigging. Duik can be a good start to learn character rigging and animation, as 2D is a bit less complex than 3D, before learning advanced 3D rigging in Blender , Maya or Cinema 4D . Duik is not meant to be quick to learn; it\u2019s meant to be efficient and quick for the people who know how to rig or animate a character. Unobtrusive, non-blocking and extensible Duik is just a tool set for After Effects. Everything Duik does could be done manually in After Effects, except much slower. This means a character rigged with Duik can still be animated with any instance of After Effects, even if Duik is not installed. This also means that if you have in-depth knowledge of After Effects, you can easily customize the way Duik works and adjust the effects and expressions it creates. Duik will never force you into a predefined workflow, it won\u2019t impose its way of doing things. More than that, Duik gives you the tools you need to extend or modify it. Lots of settings and options: each time there are different ways of doing things, Duik uses the most common or useful default option, but always expose a way to change it and lets you customize the tools. Easy-to-use but comprehensive application programming interface (API): Duik comes with a complete API to integrate it into your custom pipeline and build your own auto-rigs and tools. Open source: if you know how to code, you can customize Duik to your needs, or contribute to the development. The user interface of Duik is meant to be small and unobtrusive. It must let you focus on your job and be discreet. To achieve this goal, it\u2019s as small as possible while staying intuitive, user-friendly and quick to use. It\u2019s also meant to blend as much as possible into the User Interface of After Effects, instead of standing out. Should I use Duik? Rigging - no matter what software you use - is a complicated subject that requires advanced knowledge of both character animation, the software you are using to do the rigging, and, ideally a good understanding of anatomy. Before using Duik to create and animate character rigs, you should master: General basics of animation , including character animation (body mechanics, acting, walk cycles, etc.), and basic anatomy.

It\u2019s also useful for professional compositors and more generally for all people having enough experience with After Effects. Although its goal is to ease the rigging and animation process and it comes with a lot of automated tools, it always lets you customize the way it works and gives you access to all low-level tools used within higher level features like auto-rigs. That means you can do anything you\u2019d like with Duik, as it is very comprehensive. You\u2019re not limited to the use of automatic processes and auto-rigs . Most of the tools are very similar to what you can find in any advanced rigged character animation software, mostly in 3D, like Blender , Maxon Cinema 4D or Autodesk Maya . A skilled 3D rigger will quickly learn how to use Duik. A beginner learning Duik will know also the basics of 3D rigging. Duik can be a good start to learn character rigging and animation, as 2D is a bit less complex than 3D, before learning advanced 3D rigging in Blender , Maya or Cinema 4D . Duik is not meant to be quick to learn; it\u2019s meant to be efficient and quick for the people who know how to rig or animate a character.","title":"A professional tool set"},{"location":"getting-started/introduction.html#unobtrusive-non-blocking-and-extensible","text":"Duik is just a tool set for After Effects. Everything Duik does could be done manually in After Effects, except much slower. This means a character rigged with Duik can still be animated with any instance of After Effects, even if Duik is not installed. This also means that if you have in-depth knowledge of After Effects, you can easily customize the way Duik works and adjust the effects and expressions it creates. Duik will never force you into a predefined workflow, it won\u2019t impose its way of doing things. More than that, Duik gives you the tools you need to extend or modify it. Lots of settings and options: each time there are different ways of doing things, Duik uses the most common or useful default option, but always expose a way to change it and lets you customize the tools. Easy-to-use but comprehensive application programming interface (API): Duik comes with a complete API to integrate it into your custom pipeline and build your own auto-rigs and tools. Open source: if you know how to code, you can customize Duik to your needs, or contribute to the development. The user interface of Duik is meant to be small and unobtrusive. It must let you focus on your job and be discreet. To achieve this goal, it\u2019s as small as possible while staying intuitive, user-friendly and quick to use. It\u2019s also meant to blend as much as possible into the User Interface of After Effects, instead of standing out.","title":"Unobtrusive, non-blocking and extensible"},{"location":"getting-started/introduction.html#should-i-use-duik","text":"Rigging - no matter what software you use - is a complicated subject that requires advanced knowledge of both character animation, the software you are using to do the rigging, and, ideally a good understanding of anatomy.

The process can be summarized in just a few words: Create an armature Create bones Link artwork layers to the bones Create controls Auto-rig Tweak the controllers if you\u2019d like Add other constraints if needed For each of these steps, Duik helps you with a lot of automation, and the basic rig of a standard character should take no more than a few minutes. Then, you\u2019re ready to animate: Prepare the animation Add the rigged composition to your scene(s) Extract the controllers to animate Automate some parts of the animation Use Duik\u2019s Procedural animation tools to animate more easily and quickly Use the Animation panel to tweak your keyframes Armatures and bones Bones are layers you can add in your composition which will drive the animations, like the rig of a real puppet. The process is very simple: create or import your artwork in After Effects, add Bones and move them to the right spots (the joints of the limbs). Then you can rig those Bones and link the design layers to the corresponding Bone layers. This way, the rig you create is independent from the design. This means it\u2019s easier to adjust the design even after the rig has been made, or even to re-use the same rig with other designs. Also, this rigging process is easier to fix or change if you ever need to adjust it even when you\u2019re already in the animation process. Controllers Using the auto-rig, and a set of constraints, what you end with are Controllers to drive the animation. You animate the controllers, they drive the bones through the constraints, and voil\u00e0! Your character moves. Constraints The interaction between the Controllers and the Bones , and between the Bones themselves, happens through some Constraints . Some of them are the core tools of Duik since the first version, like IK which drive the bending of limbs, and the Pins which are used to control any spatial properties like puppet pins or the emitter of a particle effect, or any B\u00e9zier value like shapes or masks. There is also a whole set of constraints to automate even more movements and make the animator\u2019s life very easier: it\u2019s possible to animate parenting with the Parent Constraint , or to constrain a layer to a B\u00e9zier path, to attach a layer to other layers using weights, etc. Auto-rig Let\u2019s face it, most of the time you only need to rig standard animals, with legs, arms, spine, maybe a tail\u2026 All what differs are the hair, some props and cloth. The Auto-rig is a versatile tool to automate most of this process. It is able to recognize predefined bones created by Duik and rig them automatically. It handles all kinds of limbs and animals, even imaginary ones. All you have to do is to create the Bones, the Auto-rig will do the rest, adding constraints and controllers for a fully rigged character. All that will be remaining are specific cases (hair, props), and facial rigging which is not automated yet . Procedural animation As soon as your character is rigged, you can begin the animation, being helped by a lot of Automations . These Automations are procedural animations and dynamics to quickly set up the most common animations and then focus on the characterization of your character. You can automate wiggles, springs, wheels, etc. with customizable and advanced controls for example to loop the effects, and access each and every detail quickly and easily.

Project Items : Checks if there aren\u2019t too many items in the project, to ensure optimal performance. Duplicated Footage : Makes sure there aren\u2019t footage imported twice or more. In this case, you should replace all instances with the same item, and remove unused items from the project. Unused Footage : Makes sure there aren\u2019t any unused footage in the project. In this case, you should reduce the project. Precompositions : To keep the project tidy, there shouldn\u2019t be any precomposition in the root of the project panel, they should all be stored in subfolders, keeping only main compositions in the root. Main Compositions : Main compositions are unused compositions, compositions which are not precompositions, and which are meant to be rendered in the end. They should all be gathered in the same folder (or the project root), and their number should be limited. Otherwise it\u2019s a sign the project may be reduced. Memory in Use : The memory in use by After Effects is constantly growing. When it gets too high, it may be time to purge the memory. Be careful, because of After Effects memory leaks, the value displayed here is not accurate: leaked memory isn\u2019t tracked.

You can also adjust each test settings with the right-hand options button, especially set different limits for warnings, according to your own needs. \u25b7 Many of these tests help you keep an optimal performance. Read the Advanced / Performance section for more details. Composition Names : Checks if all compositions have a unique name. This is important to make sure expressions won\u2019t break. Layer Names : Checks if all the layers in the active composition have a unique name. This is important to make sure expressions won\u2019t break. Expression Engine : Checks if the current expression engine is the JavaScript engine. Project Size : Makes sure the project doesn\u2019t get too big, to ensure optimal performance. Project Items : Checks if there aren\u2019t too many items in the project, to ensure optimal performance. Duplicated Footage : Makes sure there aren\u2019t footage imported twice or more. In this case, you should replace all instances with the same item, and remove unused items from the project. Unused Footage : Makes sure there aren\u2019t any unused footage in the project. In this case, you should reduce the project. Precompositions : To keep the project tidy, there shouldn\u2019t be any precomposition in the root of the project panel, they should all be stored in subfolders, keeping only main compositions in the root. Main Compositions : Main compositions are unused compositions, compositions which are not precompositions, and which are meant to be rendered in the end. They should all be gathered in the same folder (or the project root), and their number should be limited. Otherwise it\u2019s a sign the project may be reduced.

Reynaud, La Nature, revue des sciences, Louis Poyet, 1882 Public domain. Add / Edit keyframes The first line of the temporal interpolation section lets you very quickly create or edit keyframe types. You can switch between the add or edit mode in the options . Edit keyframes Select a bunch of keyframes. Click one of the buttons to set the type of keyframe interpolation to the selection. Note When setting a type with B\u00e9zier interpolation ( , or ), the keyframe ease uses the values of the sliders, and not the default After Effects values. Add keyframes Select some properties Click one of the buttons to add keyframes with the corresponding interpolation type. By default, Duik adds keyframes on all animated properties it\u2019ll find, but you can set it to only add keyframes on explicitly selected properties if you prefer. By default, Duik works only with selected layers , but you can tell it to use all layers ; in this case it\u2019ll add keyframes in all properties of the composition, no matter the selection. Be careful, this may be a bit long if there are a lot of animated properties. Edit keyframe ease The second part of the temporal interpolation section is a keyframe ease editor, used to quickly adjust the keyframe ease on selected keyframes very quickly. In After Effects, the keyframe ease, which actually controls the B\u00e9zier interpolation between keyframes, consists in two values: The influence controls what would be the length of the tangent of the B\u00e9zier curve in the graph editor; for horizontal tangents (i.e. with 0 velocity), it directly controls the acceleration (ease out) and deceleration (ease in) of the motion around the keyframe. The velocity is a signed value controlling the speed of the motion before (ease in) and after (ease out) the keyframe; the sign of the value tells the direction of the movement. In the graph editor, it is the angle of the tangents controlling the B\u00e9zier curve. The first line with the dropdown menu let\u2019s you quickly apply, add or remove easing presets. Below are two groups of two sliders. The first group sets the influence, the second group sets the velocity. The sliders on the left-hand side set the ease in (before the keyframe), the sliders on the right-hand side set the ease out (after the keyframe) 1 . The three apply buttons set the easing values to the selected keyframes; the first one sets both the influence and velocity, while the two others can be used to set only the influence or only the velocity. Tip Actually, you don\u2019t really need the apply buttons, except to apply already existing values to other keyframes: as soon as you edit the value of one of the sliders, it\u2019s automatically applied on the selected keyframes. Velocities In After Effects, velocities are an absolute value, which depends on the property where it is used. In can be in pixels per second for spatial properties, or in degrees per second for angles, etc. Duik uses a value relative to the velocity of a linear interpolation, given in percent, which is automatically converted to and from After Effects absolute velocities. This allows to copy and set the interpolation from any keyframe to any other keyframe on any property. With this system: 0 % velocity means no velocity. 100 % is the equivalent of the continuous mode of After Effects: It\u2019s the velocity of a linear interpolation. -100 % is the same as above but going in the other direction. Copy and paste keyframe ease values Select a keyframe. Click the pick button. The influence and velocity values are set on the sliders. Select the destination keyframes. Click one of the apply buttons. Presets Select some keyframes Select the preset in the dropdown menu The preset values are automatically set on the sliders below You can further apply these values with the apply buttons. To add a preset, set the values you need with the four sliders then click the add button. To remove a preset, select it in the list and click the remove button. To the contrary of other animation software, in After Effects the interpolation is set on a single keyframe, around it, and \u201c in \u201d means arriving in the keyframe , before it, \u201c out \u201d means getting out of the keyframe , after it.

First public performance of Reynaud\u2019s \u2018Theatre Optique\u2019 in Paris, Louis Poyet, 1892 Public domain. Not only the NLA can edit your animations together, but it also can actually transition between animations as simply as a crossfade effect, by animating simple opacity values. This video is part of the official comprehensive video course about Duik \u00c1ngela Usage To use the NLA , you need to start from a base composition, containing what you wish to animate, which can be anything: simple layers, rigged character, props, using or not using Duik Controllers . This video is part of the official comprehensive video course about Duik \u00c1ngela Creation Like other tools in Duik, you first have to select what you\u2019re rigging/animating and then click on the Non-linear Animation button. Depending on the selection, this is how Duik will create and rig the NLA using the active composition: If Duik finds any selected properties , it will rig them, and only them. Else, if Duik finds any selected layers , it will rig all transform properties (position, rotation, scale, opacity) of these layers, plus the effects if the layer is a Duik Controller . Else, Duik will rig all transform properties and effects of all Duik Controllers , if any. Finally, if Duik did not find anything else, it will rig all transform properties of all layers . Note The current values (e.g. the current pose of the character) will be the \u201cneutral\u201d values, the \u201crest\u201d pose. They are the values from which the animation will be generated, and to which the NLA will fall back if there\u2019s no animation. Duik then creates a few NLA Compositions . By default, without selection, the NLA rigs all transform properties of the Duik controller layers. From a single base composition: the NLA creates a folder containing four new compositions: These compositions are: NLA.Clip:: name : Clips are the compositions containing the actual animated clips; they\u2019re where you animate the layers, using either keyframes or expressions. There can be as many NLA.Clip compositions as you need. You can quickly create new clips from the NLA options in the Duik Animation panel. NLA.Edit:: name : Edit** is the composition where you can edit your animated clips together. NLA.Original:: name is a copy of the original composition. It is used to create new clips. NLA.Render:: name is the composition containing the result of the edit, i.e. the clips edited together with their transitions. It is the composition which may be rendered or used as a precompositions in other parts of the project. Warning Do not change the first part of the name of these compositions (before and including :: ) as it is used by Duik and the NLA expressions to identify these compositions. The rest, the end of the name, can be safely modified at any time. Animated clips ( NLA.Clip:: ) The actual animations are made in the NLA.Clip:: compositions. Open these compositions and animate your layers as you would in any other composition. You can use either keyframes, expressions or any Duik feature, the NLA will work with all animated values no matter how they\u2019re controlled. To create new clips , you can either duplicate an existing clip (to work from the existing animation) or use the Add new clip button in the NLA options in the Duik Animation panel. This button will create a new clip for the NLA corresponding to the active composition (it doesn\u2019t matter which one it is as long as it belongs the the NLA , i.e. its name starts with \u201c NLA. \u201d). You can - and it is recommended to - change the duration of the \u201c NLA.Clip:: \u201d compositions, so they fit the exact duration of the animation. Edit clips together To edit the clips together and benefit from the powerful NLA features, open the NLA.Edit:: composition. From this comp, you can edit the clips together as you would with video clips in a video editing software. You can trim , move , duplicate the clips. To work with the edit: The NLA.Clip:: precompositions must be hidden. They\u2019re used by the NLA to generate the animation, but they\u2019re not actually used for rendering. The result is rendered in the NLA.Render:: composition. That\u2019s the reason why you should keep it enabled as the first layer of the NLA.Edit:: composition; this is the way to see the result of the edit, in real time. At times when there are no clips in the timeline (or if all their opacity is at 0 % ), the NLA falls back to the original values as they were before the creation of the NLA . Adding other properties to the NLA According to the way you\u2019ve setup the NLA , you may want to add other properties to be animated and rigged by the NLA . There are two simple ways to do that: First, open the NLA.Render:: composition. Then, you can either: Copy and paste the NLA expression from any property to the property you wish to add. Or select the new properties, and click on the Non-Linear animation button in the Animation Panel of Duik. Looping animation and time remapping You can use and modify the time remap property of the NLA.Clip:: precompositions in the NLA.Edit:: composition. This is a nice and easy way to change the speed of the animation, or to loop them, either using time remap keyframes, expressions or the Duik Looper feature. Transition between animation Animations can be controlled using the opacity of the the NLA.Clip:: precompositions. 100 % plays the animation as it is, 0 % deactivates it, and values in between multiply the values, effectively weighting the animations. This can especially be used to animate transitions between clips , for example to transition between a standing pose and a walk cycle, and then from a walk cycle to a run cycle. This works exactly as if you were animating a crossfade between video clips, except that the NLA doesn\u2019t actually animates the opacity but really animates the transition of all animated properties between the animated clips. Tip An NLA::Weight slider is also added in the effects of the NLA.Clip:: precompositions, which controls the weight the same way as the opacity of the layer, except that it\u2019s not limited to the range [0 %, 100 %] . You can use this slider instead of the opacity if you wish to extrapolate the animation. Use or render the result You can use either the NLA.Edit:: or the NLA.Render:: compositions to include the edited animation inside other compositions or to render it.","title":"Non-Linear Animation"},{"location":"guide/animation/nla.html#non-linear-animation","text":"Using the Non-Linear Animation tool, abbreviated as NLA , you can edit animation clips the same way you would edit video clips in a non-linear editing software ( NLE ) like Adobe Premiere or Avid Media Composer for example, but right into After Effects , keeping all your animation editable at any time.

Notepad with a drawing of an unknown woman, perhaps Johann Gauss born Osthoff, Carl Friedrich Gau\u00df, 1804 Public domain. In After Effects, like in almost all animation software, interpolation between keyframes is either linear or using a B\u00e9zier function. Although using a B\u00e9zier function to interpolate keyframes is very powerful, it can take a lot of time to precisely adjust, as between two keyframes there are four parameters to set (two coordinates per B\u00e9zier control point, a.k.a. tangent). Duik can help you with the process, either by controlling the B\u00e9zier interpolation with less parameters and some automation, or by introducing completely different interpolation functions * . Select some properties Click the Interpolator button. Duik adds an effect on the layer to let you easily control the interpolation on the properties. Tip When you\u2019ve applied the Interpolator on some properties and then want to use the same Interpolator on other properties, you can just copy and paste the expression in the new properties. Effect You first have to choose the interpolation type to use on the property. Duik proposes these types (read the details below): None (use keyframes) Linear B\u00e9zier Gaussian Logistic (sigmoid) Logarithmic Exponential Except None and Linear , all these functions can be quickly adjusted with the Rate value. Tip Both the interpolation type and the rate properties can be animated; this way you can easily use multiple interpolation methods on the same property at different times! The Interpolator can also be used to extrapolate the keyframes, i.e. to continue the animation after the last keyframe (e.g. loop or follow through), or before the first one. It is even able to detect some fixed parts in the animation in between the keyframes to extrapolate some movement in these parts. Interpolation None (use keyframes) With this mode, Duik will not interpolate between the keyframes but let After Effects do the interpolation as you wish, using standard After Effects B\u00e9zier or linear methods. This is useful if you\u2019d like to use the Interpolator only for its extrapolation (loop and follow through) capabilities. Linear This is a very simple linear interpolation, similar to the default After Effects keyframes. Linear interpolation. B\u00e9zier With this mode, you can use a standard B\u00e9zier function to interpolate, but control the parameters more easily. B\u00e9zier interpolation. Duik uses carefully chosen default values for the actual B\u00e9zier parameters, and lets you quickly adjust the easing using only the Rate property of the Interpolator effect. But you can also manually adjust everything in the B\u00e9zier options section of the effect. To make it quick and easy to control both B\u00e9zier control points (tangents) at once, you can use the IN/Out ratio . With this value, both tangents are horizontal (the After Effects easing speed in 0 ), and you control the ratio between the length of the two tangents (the After Effects easing influence ). At 50 % , both tangents have the same length, at 0 % the out influence is 0 % and at 100 % it\u2019s the opposite. With this ratio set, you can then control the actual length of both tangents at once with the Rate property of the Interpolator effect, which makes it quick and easy to adjust the B\u00e9zier interpolation of all the keyframes at once. Don\u2019t forget all these values can be animated! If you need to set the equivalent of the After Effects easing speed (i.e. the angle of the tangents) or control manually and precisely all the values, check the Use Advanced options box and set the values in the Advanced section. Gaussian Using a gaussian function to interpolate the keyframes helps creating very natural and smooth movements with a single parameter, set with the Rate property of the Interpolator effect. Gaussian interpolation. This function is also called a bell function because of the shape it generates. The resulting motion feels very natural, especially for characters, animals, to show their will : although the movement is very smooth, the acceleration is a bit faster than the deceleration, which perfectly mimics the actual acceleration and deceleration of voluntary movements. This acceleration and deceleration can easily be adjusted with the Rate property. Note The interpolation generated by this gaussian function can\u2019t actually be generated by a standard B\u00e9zier function (without adding intermediary keyframes); the deceleration can be much smoother, and the motion feels much more dynamic. Logistic (Sigmoid) To the contrary of the gaussian function, the interpolation using the logistic function is perfectly symmetrical, with the same acceleration and deceleration (thus its other name, Sigmoid ). This may be useful for more mechanical movements. Logistic interpolation. To the contrary of the Duik B\u00e9zier interpolation, with the logistic function, what\u2019s controlled with the Rate property is the actual speed of the movement. That means the interpolation may not complete if there\u2019s not enough time between the keyframes or if the rate is too small (when the speed is not high enough to finish and stop the movement given the time between the keyframes). Note The movement never actually stop using this function, but given enough time to slow down it\u2019s slow enough to seem to stop. The fact that the speed may not be 0 on the keyframe may actually be very useful when using extrapolations, especially the continue or follow through modes. Logistic interpolation with the extrapolation set on continue. In the example above, the interpolation is set to Logistic (sigmoid) and both the In and Out extrapolations are set to Continue . This creates a movement which never stops . That would be very difficult to set with a standard B\u00e9zier function. This interpolation works nice with the follow through extrapolation too. Logistic interpolation with the extrapolation set on follow through. Logarithmic or Exponential Logarithmic and Exponential are always decelerating and always accelerating functions respectively. Logarithmic interpolation. Exponential interpolation. They\u2019re very useful to animate apparitions or disappearances, objects coming in or getting out of the frame. Similarly to the logistic (sigmoid) function, what makes them interesting is that the generated movement never really stops, and this is especially difficult to setup precisely using standard B\u00e9zier functions. The generated motion is also very smooth. Logarithmic interpolation, with the extrapolation set on continue. You can use the Rate property to adjust the acceleration or deceleration rate. Extrapolation The Interpolator can also extrapolate the movement, continue it after the keyframes, or before them. First, the Extrapolation to property to 100 % (or any value other than 0 % ) to enable it. Tip The Extrapolation property can be animated to enable, disable or adjust the extrapolation at any time. The In extrapolation section contains the options for the extrapolation before the keyframes, the Out extrapolation section for the extrapolation after the keyframes. There are several types of extrapolation: Constant : values are not extrapolated, the value of the last keyframe is used. Continue : the motion continues smoothly after the last keyframe, depending on the interpolation set before the keyframe. Continue extrapolation after a linear interpolation. Continue extrapolation before and after a logistic interpolation. Offset : the motion is repeated, the values being added to the last known value. Offset extrapolation. Cycle : the motion is repeated. Cycle extrapolation . Pingpong : the motion is repeated, reversed every other cycle. Pingpong extrapolation . Follow through : a follow through * animation is generated ( Out extrapolation only). Follow through extrapolation . Bounce : a bouncing animation is generated ( Out extrapolation only). Bounce extrapolation . By default, the Interpolator extrapolates before or after the existing keyframes . You can also extrapolate during still parts of the animation, between keyframes. That\u2019s very useful for example to add some follow through animation every time the animation stops, even if there are other keyframes later in the timeline. You can choose the number of keyframes to be used to extrapolate the motion (for the Offset , Cycle , and Pingpong modes only). If this is set to 0 , the Interpolator will use all available keyframes. The damping value controls the time it takes for the motion to come to a full stop (and get back to the last keyframe value). This value is especially useful with the follow through or bounce mode, but can be used to dampen the other modes too, and progressively stop a loop. With the Out extrapolation set to follow through or bounce, you can also control the elasticity of the extrapolation, which will change the amplitude and frequency of the extrapolation. You could also use the Extrapolation property with values different than 100 % to control the amplitude. Color Options When interpolating colors, changing the colorspace may help generating better colors between the keyframes. With After Effects by default, colors are interpolated in an RGB colorspace, and this often generates desaturated colors in between; changing this colorspace may help improve the interpolation by generating more vivid colors in between. RGB : the default interpolation, where the Red, Green and Blue channels are interpolated separately. HSL : the color is converted to Hue, Saturation and Luminosity channels before being interpolated and converted back to RGB. This allows for better and more vivid colors in between, but if the colors are too far away from each other in the Hue channel, this may cause the interpolation to go through all the hues of the rainbow. Shortest-path HSL : this is similar to HSL but making sure the Hue channel is always interpolated through the shortest path possible, making sure the number of different hues during the interpolation is as small as possible. Longest-path HSL : this is similar to Shortest-path HSL but taking the longest path with the greatest number of hues as possible. Combined RGB SL : this mode interpolates the Saturation and Luminosity separately, and uses an RGB interpolation to generate the interpolated Hue, then converts back everything to RGB. The result is slightly different from the Shortest-path HSL and depending on the colors to be interpolated may be a bit better or feel more dynamic. The result depends a lot on the colors to be interpolated and how different they are. The best is to try all the different modes to see which fits better to your needs.","title":"Interpolator"},{"location":"guide/animation/tools/interpolator.html#interpolator","text":"This video is part of the official comprehensive video course about Duik \u00c1ngela The Interpolator help you interpolate * (and extrapolate * ) your keyframe values with handy methods other than the usual B\u00e9zier and linear functions, or loopIn() and loopOut() expressions.

Although using a B\u00e9zier function to interpolate keyframes is very powerful, it can take a lot of time to precisely adjust, as between two keyframes there are four parameters to set (two coordinates per B\u00e9zier control point, a.k.a. tangent).

It\u2019s a very poowerful tool to help you achieve the best animation with very little work; for any simple enough animation, it\u2019s able to do all the tedious interpolation * and some extrapolation * work for you, adding all the details needed in the animation using only simple linear keyframes. A cat running, Eadweard Muybridge, 1887 Public domain. It\u2019s a smart tool which takes a lot of parameters into account to generate the best animation. To achieve this result, we\u2019ve used advanced coding techniques, like Fuzzy Logics 2 ; everything uses analytical methods though, there\u2019s no simulation nor A.I. or machine learning: this is a tool for animators made by animators . It\u2019s not physically accurate; every generated motion has been designed and fine tuned to be the best according to the animator\u2019s view, not to mimic perfectly the real world. Like any true animation. Note The term simulation is actually used in the Kleaner properties and this document, but it really refers to a fake simulation, tweaked to generate a better animation and not physically accurate nor using any actual physical law or formula. The Kleaner has a lot of options though, so that you can still have a fine control on your animation, or even manually adjust each and every little part, while still working quickly on the whole animation at once by just setting some general parameters. A simple animation curve generated by the Kleaner from two linear keyframes An animation curve generated by the Kleaner from three linear keyframes An animation curve generated by the Kleaner from three linear keyframes As you can see, the Kleaner adapts the generated animation to any keyframe available, which makes it easy to tweak the animation by just using a few linear keyframes. You can use the Kleaner with any property which can have expressions. Select the properties. Click the Kleaner button. Choose one of the presets. Tip When using the Kleaner, just leave all your keyframes to linear interpolation and use the Kleaner to tweak the animation. For spatial properties, you should keep only the first and last keyframe of each movement to linear, and set all in-between keyframes to rove across time , using them only to tune the trajectory. Tip The Kleaner is best used on multiple properties at once; this way you can control lots of movements with a single effect. Spatial properties and other properties are handled a bit differently though, and it may be better to add the Kleaner twice for spatial properties and other properties separately. You can adjust the settings and tweak the Kleaner with the effect Duik adds to the layer. To make it easier to use and discover, the settings are divided in three parts: Some general properties describing the object being animated, like its weight and initial energy, or will, etc. Detailed parameters for all animation principles applied by the Kleaner, to let you go into small details if you wish, or customize the animation further. Advanced settings to control low-level parameters of the Kleaner. Tip When you\u2019ve applied the Kleaner on some properties and then want to use the same Kleaner on other properties, you can just copy and paste the expression in the new properties. Presets When you click the Kleaner button, you have to choose one of these settings: Alive (anticipation + interpolation + follow through) Use this preset with any character (or object, or part of a character) which moves voluntarily (i.e. the movement doesn\u2019t have an external cause, like gravity or a hit). With this preset, the Kleaner applies an anticipation * to the movement, then interpolates accordingly to the general parameters you\u2019ll choose, and ends the movement with a follow through * animation. It also adds overlap * and drag * to spatial properties. Inanimate (interpolation + follow through) This is almost the same as the Alive preset, except the anticipation is disabled 3 . True stop (anticipation + interpolation) This is the same preset as the Alive preset, except there\u2019s no follow through at the end of the animation, to let you manually animate it. Exact keyframes (interpolation only) With this preset, the Kleaner only interpolates between the keyframes, without anticipation nor follow through animation. With this setup, the resulting animation actually goes through the exact values of the keyframes, which may not be the case with the previous presets. Spring (follow through only) Use this preset if you want to animate manually, but have an automatic follow through at the end of the animation. The Kleaner also adds some overlapping and dragging animation on spatial properties. Spring (no simulation) This is the same preset as the previous one, except all simulations are disabled. This improves the performance a lot, but there won\u2019t be any overlapping and dragging animation on spatial properties anymore. Bounce (follow through only) This is the same as the Spring preset, but for objects bouncing on a surface instead of turning around the end value. Bounce (no simulation) This is the same as the Spring preset, but for objects bouncing on a surface instead of turning around the end value. Limits Use this preset if all you need is to bound the values of the property inside some predefined (but animatable) limits. General parameters You can use these general parameters to set the main properties of the object being animated. These are arbitrary, unitless values; if you feel the object is not heavy enough, raise a bit its Weight , that\u2019s all. Note Duik and the Kleaner can do much for you. But it can\u2019t move keyframes and change the duration of the animation ! If even with these settings your animation is too fast or the object feels too light, it may be because you need to adjust the timing * of the animation, move the keyframes and make it longer, and vice versa. Before applying the Kleaner, try to time the animation the best you can (it\u2019s easier with the default easy-ease interpolation than linear keyframes, select the keyframes and hit F9 ). Once you\u2019ve set these values as best as you can, you can further improve and customize the animation by adjusting the fine tuning parameters. Fine Tune A galloping horse and rider, Eadweard Muybridge, 1887 Public domain. The Kleaner does a lot of things for you, effectively applying some general animation principles. What it does exactly also depends on the type of property being animated. Anticipation is what happens before the actual movement, to get momentum before moving the object. It\u2019s one of the 12 Disney\u2019s animation principles 4 . The Will is shown with the anticipation. The Motion Interpolation is what happens between the keyframes, it describes how the Kleaner smoothes the animation and makes it more dynamic. It\u2019s mostly with this interpolation that the Weight of the object is shown, and the Will of the character, but almost all other general parameters are also used to tweak it. The Overlap , or drag , is what makes objects lag behind their parents, the other objects they\u2019re attached to. The Kleaner is able to add overlapping animation and drag to spatial properties . The Follow through is what happens after the keyframes and the main animation. It is how the object oscillates or bounces on a surface before coming to a full stop. Duik is able to simulate Soft bodies if the Kleaner is applied on spatial properties . In this case, these spatial properties will lag a bit behind the main motion of the layer itself (similarly to the overlap ), thus creating this soft body simulation. This works especially well on After Effects puppet pins, or any other effect deforming the layer. You can use the Limits to bound the values and make sure they don\u2019t go above or under specific values. Anticipation This video is part of the official comprehensive video course about Duik \u00c1ngela Anticipation * is used to prepare the audience for an action, and to make the action appear more realistic. A dancer jumping off the floor has to bend the knees first; a golfer making a swing has to swing the club back first. In a more technical way, it\u2019s the fact that before the actual movement, the object takes the opposite direction to get momentum. Anticipation generated by the Kleaner around a linear keyframe. First, the anticipation is computed according to the general parameters. You can then tweak it with these two simple values: Anticipation controls the amplitude of the anticipation. Duration changes how long before the first keyframe the anticipation starts. Motion interpolation The Kleaner automatically interpolates * the motion between keyframes, according to the general parameters. For a more dynamic and realistic interpolation, it uses a function based on the Gaussian function which generates nice, asymmetrical and dynamic curves, where the acceleration is faster than the deceleration, which better mimics a natural movement than what can be achieved with B\u00e9zier curve. Interpolation generated by the Kleaner between two linear keyframes The Kleaner automatically generates the best curve possible going through all the keyframes, automatically detecting where the motion stops, slows down, accelerates or changes direction. Use the Motion interpolation value to blend the result of the Kleaner with the actual After Effects interpolation; this way you can use your own B\u00e9zier interpolation if needed. You can animate this value to deactivate the Kleaner interpolation only for some part of the animation. For spatial properties, if the Use Ae spatial trajectory box is checked, the Kleaner will not affect the spatial interpolation. This works very well if you just set the first and last keyframe to linear interpolation, and all in-between keyframes to rove across time . In this case you just have to adjust the trajectory with the B\u00e9zier pen in the viewport, and let the Kleaner do the temporal interpolation; this is the recommended way of using it, but you can also disable this option, and let the Kleaner do all the work for you (spatial and temporal). In this case, the Kleaner will treat each axis separately as if the dimensions were separated. Overlap Overlapping action * is the tendency for parts of the body to move at different rates (an arm will move on different timing of the head and so on). A related technique is drag , where a character starts to move and parts of them take a few frames to catch up. These parts can be inanimate objects like clothing or the antenna on a car, or parts of the body, such as arms or hair. On the human body, the torso is the core, with arms, legs, head and hair appendices that normally follow the torso\u2019s movement. Body parts with much tissue, such as large stomachs and breasts, or the loose skin on a dog, are more prone to independent movement than bonier body parts. The Kleaner helps you with this animation when applied in spatial properties . It checks the motion of all the parents of layer containing the spatial property to automatically delay it a bit and let it drag, according to the general parameters (weight, flexibility\u2026). This is considered a simulation and may reduce the performance of After Effects; it is deactivated when simulations are disabled in the Advanced parameters. You can adjust the overlap by changing this value; set it to 0 % to completely disable it (and improve performance). Note There\u2019s no need to disable it on non-spatial properties where this value is not used at all. Follow through Follow through * means that loosely tied parts of a body should continue moving after the character has stopped and the parts should keep moving beyond the point where the character stopped only to be subsequently \u201cpulled back\u201d towards the center of mass or exhibiting various degrees of oscillation damping. The Flexibility controls both the amplitude and the frequency of the oscillation (which are closely tied in real life): with more flexibility, the frequency gets lower and the amplitude gets higher. The Duration controls the damping of the oscillation, how long it lasts before coming to a full stop. If the Bounce box is checked, instead of oscillating, the property will bounce on the last value, like a ball bouncing on a surface. The Kleaner generates accurate follow through, but sometimes you may prefer to amplify it a bit and make it more visible. This will adjust the height (the amplitude) of bounces. If you set the Amplification to 0 % , you can also deactivate the follow through. An oscillating follow through generated by the Kleaner. An bouncing follow through generated by the Kleaner. Note When oscillating, the frequency is stable and doesn\u2019t change until the object stops. When bouncing, the frequency raises (the bounces get shorter and shorter). The Kleaner being a tool for animators made by animators, it is not physically accurate; if it were, some bounces would happen between actual frames of the composition, which would be bad because there would be no frame where the contact between the object and the surface is visible. But the Kleaner makes sure all contacts happen exactly on actual frames of the composition, as an animator would do. Soft body The Soft body simulation is very similar to the overlap, but specific for spatial properties other than the position of the layer, like After Effects puppet pins for example. The result is that the layer will appear flexible, soft, elastic, what\u2019s called a soft body in opposition to rigid bodies . This is considered a simulation and may reduce the performance of After Effects; it is deactivated when simulations are disabled in the Advanced parameters. You can adjust the soft body by changing this value; set it to 0 % to completely disable it (and improve performance). Limits You can use the limits to make sure that even during the anticipation or final oscillation (follow through) the property with the Kleaner is bounded between this maximum and minimum limit. Use the softness to make the motion slow down before hitting the limit. Note When limits are used, they\u2019re also applied to the value of keyframes, effectively limiting the actual value no matter if it comes from the Kleaner or the keyframes. It may be useful to apply the Kleaner on some property just to benefit from the limits, and a preset has been made just for this. Advanced Parameters Randomness The Kleaner adds some randomness to some values to make sure that even if it\u2019s the same Kleaner controlling multiple properties, they will not be perfectly synchronized. This makes the animation feel much more natural. You can adjust this randomness, and set it to 0 % to completely deactivate it. Performance As a complete and complex tool, the Kleaner may reduce the performance of After Effects, especially when used on spatial properties. You can use these settings to improve the performance by disabling the simulations or the general parameters if you don\u2019t need them. If you notice artifacts in the motion blur or imprecision with some interpolations and follow through, you can raise a bit the Time precision or Value precision , but be careful as this may slow down the evaluation of the expressions.

Using Fuzzy Logic is a way to test the veracity of a statement, and get a nuanced result, which can then be used to set nuanced values according to the truthness, the veracity, obtained from the statement. For example, if one wants to adjust the power of a fan, one needs to check the temperature and adjust the fan accordingly. With boolean logic, the statement IF the temperature IS hot THEN SET the fan on will either turn the fan on at full power or completely off, according to a predefined limit value. With Fuzzy Logic, both the veracity and the result being fuzzy and more nuanced, the same statement will adjust precisely the power of the fan according to the hotness. With a single simple rule like this, it is like a conversion (interpolation) of the temperature value into a power value. But like Boolean logic, Fuzzy Logic becomes very interesting when combining veracity and rules. For example, it becomes easy to code a program with these rules: IF the temperature IS low OR humidity IS high THEN SET the fan on AND SET the heater on You can read our guide about Fuzzy Logic and use our libraries in your scripts and expressions on fuzzylogic.rxlab.guide \u21a9 Anticipation is an animation principle invented to show the will . You should never have anticipation if the movement is not voluntary, but an object can have an anticipation, if it is manipulated by a character for example. \u21a9 Disney\u2019s twelve basic principles of animation were introduced by the Disney animators Ollie Johnston and Frank Thomas in their 1981 book The Illusion of Life: Disney Animation . The principles are based on the work of Disney animators from the 1930s onwards, in their quest to produce more realistic animation. The main purpose of these principles was to produce an illusion that cartoon characters adhered to the basic laws of physics, but they also dealt with more abstract issues, such as emotional timing and character appeal. cf.

It\u2019s a very poowerful tool to help you achieve the best animation with very little work; for any simple enough animation, it\u2019s able to do all the tedious interpolation * and some extrapolation * work for you, adding all the details needed in the animation using only simple linear keyframes. A cat running, Eadweard Muybridge, 1887 Public domain. It\u2019s a smart tool which takes a lot of parameters into account to generate the best animation. To achieve this result, we\u2019ve used advanced coding techniques, like Fuzzy Logics 2 ; everything uses analytical methods though, there\u2019s no simulation nor A.I. or machine learning: this is a tool for animators made by animators . It\u2019s not physically accurate; every generated motion has been designed and fine tuned to be the best according to the animator\u2019s view, not to mimic perfectly the real world. Like any true animation. Note The term simulation is actually used in the Kleaner properties and this document, but it really refers to a fake simulation, tweaked to generate a better animation and not physically accurate nor using any actual physical law or formula. The Kleaner has a lot of options though, so that you can still have a fine control on your animation, or even manually adjust each and every little part, while still working quickly on the whole animation at once by just setting some general parameters. A simple animation curve generated by the Kleaner from two linear keyframes An animation curve generated by the Kleaner from three linear keyframes An animation curve generated by the Kleaner from three linear keyframes As you can see, the Kleaner adapts the generated animation to any keyframe available, which makes it easy to tweak the animation by just using a few linear keyframes. You can use the Kleaner with any property which can have expressions. Select the properties. Click the Kleaner button. Choose one of the presets. Tip When using the Kleaner, just leave all your keyframes to linear interpolation and use the Kleaner to tweak the animation. For spatial properties, you should keep only the first and last keyframe of each movement to linear, and set all in-between keyframes to rove across time , using them only to tune the trajectory. Tip The Kleaner is best used on multiple properties at once; this way you can control lots of movements with a single effect. Spatial properties and other properties are handled a bit differently though, and it may be better to add the Kleaner twice for spatial properties and other properties separately. You can adjust the settings and tweak the Kleaner with the effect Duik adds to the layer. To make it easier to use and discover, the settings are divided in three parts: Some general properties describing the object being animated, like its weight and initial energy, or will, etc. Detailed parameters for all animation principles applied by the Kleaner, to let you go into small details if you wish, or customize the animation further. Advanced settings to control low-level parameters of the Kleaner.

You can set the start and end (in frames relative to the current time) to adjust the length of the trail.

Keep in mind that Motion trails are standard shape layers and you can do much more with them by modifying the content by yourself. The Taper settings are the same than those you can find in paths in the content of an After Effects shape layer. Advanced Parameters Using the simple (stroke) Mode , the trail is a simple open B\u00e9zier path with a stroke. Switching to the advanced (fill) Mode replaces the trail by a closed B\u00e9zier path filled with a color. This advanced mode allows for taking the 3D depth and scale of the layer into account when computing the width of the trail, so it looks like a 3D stroke (but still in a 2D shape layer). Depending on how you wish to customize the trail in the contents of the shape layer, sometimes you may also prefer a closed and filled shape than a simple stroke. Be careful though as the performance is reduced using the advanced mode as it needs a bit more computation. Using the advanced mode, the trail can look 3D Tip As the motion trail is contained in a shape layer, it\u2019s easy to change it\u2019s appearance, so use it as you wish! You can add and modify everything in the content of the Motion Trail layer. Sampling and performance The sampling controls how the motion of the layer is analyzed. With a low sampling, you may see angles appear in the trajectory of fast layers; a higher sampling generates a smoother curve for fast movements, at the cost of performance. By default, the automatic sampling tries to adjust the number of samples depending on the velocity and choose the best sampling for a smooth curve while trying to keep better performance.

Effect The Swink can be adjusted in the effects of the first selected layer. Duik automatically sets the two values A and B to oscillate around the current value of the selected property.

While the frequency changes the speed of the oscillation, the Cycle offset moves the whole oscillation in time to let you adjust exactly the value from which it starts at the beginning of the composition. This offset is set as a percentage of a complete cycle. You can use the A/B ratio to let the oscillation spend more time on one or the other value. A ratio higher than 50 % makes the time spent on the A value longer than on the B value, and vice versa.

It\u2019s a very quick and simple way to get started with walk and run animations. A nice walk or run cycle is just a click away, but you can go into details and adjust the character height and weight, but also every individual limb parameter and precisely set how it walks and runs\u2026 Woman walking downstairs, Eadweard Muybridge, 1887 Public domain. To use the Walk / Run cycle, you must have a rigged character. It can work with any rigged character though, even if it\u2019s not been rigged using Duik but other tools. Tip This Walk / Run cycle was made for bipeds, but you can achieve a quadruped walk cycle using two walk cycles: one for the front legs, shoulders, neck and head, and another one for the back legs and hips. You only have to animate the tail by yourself and adjust a few settings. Setup Before creating the Walk / Run cycle, make sure the character is standing straight, with the arms along the body, in a natural pose. You will still be able to move the controllers after the Walk / Run cycle has been created to adjust the pose and the look of the walk, or even animate them above the automatic animation to adjust it. The Walk / Run cycle is not meant to create perfect and characterized animation. It is a tool useful to get started quickly with walk or run animations which would need some tweaks to characterize them, or to animate quickly secondary, less important, characters. If the character was rigged by predefined limb bones and the Auto-rig of Duik, using the Walk Cycle is pretty straightforward: Select all the controllers of the character Click on the Walk / Run Cycle button If the character was rigged using custom bones in Duik, or any other tool ( Rubberhose , BAO Bones , Limber \u2026) or even custom expressions, you can also use the Walk / Run Cycle, but you will have to make some easy connections manually: Select all the controllers of the character (the layers used to animate it, or which contain the effects needed to animate it) Open the additional panel for the Walk / Run Cycle. Assign the layers to their corresponding limbs. The eyedropper will set the currently selected layer in the composition. Click the Walk / Run Cycle button. Duik will try to link the properties of the controllers to the walk and run cycle, but if you are using custom rigs, it may not find them all, in this case, read the effect description below to see how you can connect them manually. The Walk / Run Cycle can be adjusted in the effects of the Walk / Run cycle controller which has been created in the composition. Tip All controllers can still be animated, so you can add your own keyframes to adjust the animation to your taste or animate anything else. Feel free to move the controllers to adjust the pose of the character. Warning The procedural walk / run cycle animates the arms with Forward Kinematics ( FK ) * and thus deactivates the Inverse Kinematics ( IK ) * . The position of the controllers of the arms do not control them anymore, as the animation is made on the angles of the individual FK controls 1 . If you want to animate or adjust the arms, you can either adjust the values in the individual FK controls in the effects of the controllers, or you can enable again the IK, but this will deactivate the procedural animation on the arms. You can animate the switch between IK and FK, and Duik provides a tool to ease this IK/FK switch process in the Animation panel. Warning Make sure the left and right limbs are tagged accordingly 2 , or fix the tags before setuping the Walk / Run cycle so it recognizes correctly the sides. Effect Use the first three values to start and stop the cycle: The General motion controls both the walk and run cycles. The Walk and Run values control the two cycles; you can easily animate the transition from one to the other by cross-fading these values. The Main parameters are the general settings to globally customize andcharacterize the animation. You can use the Individual limb adjustments to further customize the cycle. The Advanced parameters can be used to tweak the cycle on a lower level. Some Useful data is exposed at the bottom of the effect. Main parameters You can set the main character traits (height, energy\u2026) with a few arbitrary values. The value have to be adjusted relatively to the character walking and running and are subjective. Changing them gives a feeling of height, energy, softness\u2026 The softness controls the drag and overlapping animation * of the limbs. Walk and Run Cycles For both cycles, you can adjust the speed at which the character is moving. This doesn\u2019t change the speed (frequency) of the steps, but their amplitude , as in real life: a given character will approximately always keep the same step frequency but change the amplitude of the steps to change its walking or running speed. Even the frequency of a run cycle and a walk cycle are similar. This being said, don\u2019t hesitate to animate the step frequency in the Advanced parameters section when you\u2019re animating the transition from the walk cycle to the run cycle if you feel the run cycle should be a bit faster. There are two types of walk cycles: Realistic and Dancing . With the Dancing mode, the body has two bounces per step, like Mickey Mouse. Individual limb adjustments For each limb, you can individually tweak each and every single part of the animation! The properties labeled swing control the rotation of the corresponding part, and the softness usually controls the drag and overlapping animation * of the parts. Advanced parameters You can use the Time offset to offset the cycle in time; this is useful for example when using the quadruped trick: apply a walk cycle to the front legs which is offset by \u00b1 20 % from the same walk cycle on the back legs. Use the Step amplitude and frequency to override all other settings and control them directly. Useful data The values exposed in the Animation data section are the actual animation. When setuping the Walk / Run cycle with a custom, non-Duik, rig, you can use the expression pickwhip to these values to apply the animation to specific properties (just add + value; at the end of the expression generated by the pickwhip). The arms animation uses FK, you need to connect them to angle properties. The feet animation uses IK, connect them to position properties. The Leg height parameter should have been set automatically by Duik, but with custom rigs or specific characters, you may need to adjust this so the cycle is correctly computed. It is the length of the straight leg, from angle to hip, in pixels. Finally, some useful values are exposed in the Computation section, which may be used in your own expressions, to synchronize other parts to the cycle animation for example. One value is especially useful: the Cycle duration , which is available in seconds or frames. To render perfect loops, you can set the work area or the composition duration to this value.

The arms animation uses FK, you need to connect them to angle properties. The feet animation uses IK, connect them to position properties. The Leg height parameter should have been set automatically by Duik, but with custom rigs or specific characters, you may need to adjust this so the cycle is correctly computed. It is the length of the straight leg, from angle to hip, in pixels. Finally, some useful values are exposed in the Computation section, which may be used in your own expressions, to synchronize other parts to the cycle animation for example. One value is especially useful: the Cycle duration , which is available in seconds or frames. To render perfect loops, you can set the work area or the composition duration to this value.

Armatures for all types of animals As there are many different types of animals, these limbs are sorted in categories. Tetrapod legs *Hominoids Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins Public Domain* Type Description Examples Notes Hominoid 1 Human-like tetrapods 2 : biped humans and apes without tails Human, Chimpanzee, Gorilla\u2026 Humans and their equals. Plantigrade Tetrapods which put the whole foot on the ground, with the heel touching the ground when they walk. Primates, bears, rabbits\u2026 The ones nearly equal to humans. Digitigrade Tetrapods which walk on their fingers. Dogs and all canines, cats and other felines, dinosaurs, walking birds\u2026 Human friends. Ungulate Tetrapods which walk on the tip of their fingers, who usually have hoofs. Horses, cattle, girafes, pigs, deers, camels, hippopotamuses\u2026 Food for humans. Arthropod Invertebrates which have more joints than tetrapods in their legs. Spiders, scorpions, ants, crabs, bees\u2026 Enemies of humans. Bird Flying digitigrades. Sparrows and pigeons but not chickens. Fish Swimming with fins. Note that Duik considers whales to be fishes too. The important thing is the way the animals move, not their actual classification. Fishes, sharks and whales. When using the auto-rig later, Duik will adjust the controls for each limb of each type of animal, to allow for the most detailed and easiest animation according to the animal you\u2019re animating. Read the next section for a complete description of the controls for each limb. In these categories, for each limb you can adjust some options before the creation, to adapt them to your design, which makes the armatures and the auto-rig extremely versatile in Duik. The choices you can make in these options depends on the design of your character, and especially which joints are available and where they are located. To learn how each kind of limb may be designed and how the corresponding bones have to be located, read the Bones / Auto-rig section. Create armatures and bones There are several ways to create armatures with Duik, depending on what you need. As all the other tools in Duik \u00c1ngela, the bone creation tools try to be smart, and change their behavior depending on the context (i.e. the current selection in the current composition). You can create either complete characters (e.g. Humans, rabbits, etc.) using the OCO meta-rig panel 3 , single limbs (e.g. arms, legs, etc.), or custom armatures. Except for complete characters, the way the bones are created will change depending on the selection. Complete characters (meta-rigs) are always built in the center of the composition, and nothing is linked to the new armature, you\u2019ll have to create the links between the artwork and the armature by yourself later. Tip Click the Bone Settings button in the toolbar of the Bones panel to access some settings, where you can change how bones are created. Read the Bones and Auto-rig / Tools / Settings section for more information about these settings. Without selection Without any selection in the composition, predefined limbs and custom armatures will be created in the center of the composition. There is a very quick way to locate the new bones where you need them though: With the pen tool, [G] , and without any layer selected, click on the location of the bones you wish to create, from the root to the tip of the limb. This will create a new shape layer with a path, each vertex of the path located at a joint of the limb. Keeping this new path selected (do not change the current tool nor click anywhere else), create the new armature with Duik. Duik will automatically locate the new bones on the vertices of the path, and then remove this temporary shape layer, used only as a reference. 1. 2. 3. With a selection With a selection, they will be moved to the selected properties or layers, and if you [Ctrl] + [Click] on the creation button, these selected properties or layers will be automatically parented to the newly created armature. If B\u00e9zier path properties (i.e. mask path or shape path) are selected, one armature will be created for each path , with one bone for each vertex of the path. Vertex and tangents will both be linked to the corresponding bone, but there is no individual control for tangents. You can create them later if you need with the Pins 4 tool. If puppet pins are selected, one armature will be created for each layer , with one bone for each puppet pin. The order of the bones depends on the order of the pins in the layer stack. You can re-order them before creating the armature to adjust how the armature is created and optionally how the pin is linked to it. If layers are selected, without any other property, one armature will be created . Each bone will be moved to the corresponding layer, and the layer can optionally be parented to it. Note If there are selected layers with their anchor points at the same location in the composition, the armature will not use the layers\u2019 position, and layers will not be parented, to avoid weird issues happening when layers share the same anchor point in the same armature. Warning Never duplicate nor copy and paste bones in After Effects, always create new armatures or use the Duplicate button in the bones panel of Duik. Internal unique identifiers are associated with the armatures, which won\u2019t be updated when you copy or duplicate the armatures in After Effects. The Auto-rig and other rigging tools in Duik need these identifiers to work correctly and may fail if they are not set properly. The Duplicate tool does this.

This makes it the cornerstone of the rigging process in Duik, which can be summarized to: Create Bones Auto-rig Animate As a smart tool, it will guess what you are trying to do, depending on the layers you have selected. It is able to add some \u201csimple\u201d IK or to rig a complete character in a single click. Note The Auto-rig is a tool in constant evolution. In each future version of Duik, it is going to work better and better, handling more different situations. Using the Auto-rig Select some layers in the composition Click the Auto-rig button. If there are bones in the selection: If there are predefined armatures (arm, leg, spine, tail\u2026), the Auto-rig will rig everything for you so you can start to animate right afterwards. If the bones are custom armatures, the Auto-rig will add IK 1 to rig them, determining which type of IK would be best according to the number and location of the layers, and the auto-rig settings. If there are Controller layers in the selection: The Auto-rig will use them when possible, depending on their location, instead of creating new controllers. This is an easy way to use your own custom controllers (you just have to make sure they\u2019re tagged ). 2 If the selection is made only of standard layers , the Auto-rig will add IK to rig them, trying to guess how they need to be rigged using their parenting and the location of their anchor points. If the layers are not parented yet, the Auto-rig is able to parent them automatically, but it\u2019s better in this case to select the layers in the right order: from the tip to the root of the limb (from hand to shoulder, or from foot to hip\u2026). Controllers As opposed to previous versions of Duik, the Auto-rig in Duik Bassel is able to create any needed controllers to rig the selected layers. You do not necessarily have to create them yourself first. This being said, if you need or want to add and use a specific controller, you just have to include it in the layer selection before running the Auto-rig. It will automatically detect and use it. This is especially useful if, for example, you want to control two different IKs with the same controller. Tip Always have a look in the effects of the Controllers after having run the Auto-rig! Depending on what has been rigged, there may be a lot of options there. Auto-rig options This video is part of the official comprehensive video course about Duik \u00c1ngela When rigging less than three layers, the auto-rig always know what to do, as it is able to create controllers to animate both using FK and IK at the same time, but with more layers, you can set the preferred behavior in the auto-rig options. With three bones you can use one of these methods: 1+2-layer IK creates a single-layer IK on the root, and a two-layer IK on the remaining two parts of the limb. Both are controlled with the same controller. This is the default way of rigging arthropod legs for example. 2+1-layer IK creates a two-layer IK on the first two parts of the limb, and a single-layer IK to control the last part. Both are controlled with the same controller. FK creates an FK controller, which has automatic overlapping animation options. B\u00e9zier IK is a kind of IK controlled by B\u00e9zier functions, similar to B\u00e9zier paths in After Effects; this is especially useful for tails or spines for example, when you want to achieve a smooth curve. B\u00e9zier FK combines a B\u00e9zier IK with FK controls, to be able to animate the IK use the rotation properties of the controllers at each end. You can also set your preference for longer chains made of more than three bones, tails and hair strands. In this case, the choice is limited to: FK , B\u00e9zier IK , B\u00e9zier FK . \u25b7 Read the Constraints / Kinematics section for more details about these options. If you check the Create a root controller box , the Auto-rig will add a master controller which can be used to translate and rotate the whole rig at once. Use the baking options to automatically bake 3 the bones before rigging them; this is important to improve the performance of the rig. It will \u201cfreeze\u201d the bones as they are at the moment you rig them, as you should not need to change their appearance anymore. All types of animals and limbs Duik can create armatures for almost all type of animals and limbs, and the auto-rig can rig them automatically. Although the type of limbs are sorted into categories corresponding to different types of animals, you can combine arbitrarily limbs from different categories. You could see these categories as different ways to rig and control the limbs, according to the way your character moves. This way you can create and rig any kind of character, from hybrids to robots. Arms and legs Spines Tails and hair Wings Fins Tip You can use the OCO meta-rigs 4 as examples of how you can combine limbs to create complete animals. cf. Constraints / Kinematics . \u21a9 cf.

With three bones you can use one of these methods: 1+2-layer IK creates a single-layer IK on the root, and a two-layer IK on the remaining two parts of the limb. Both are controlled with the same controller. This is the default way of rigging arthropod legs for example. 2+1-layer IK creates a two-layer IK on the first two parts of the limb, and a single-layer IK to control the last part. Both are controlled with the same controller. FK creates an FK controller, which has automatic overlapping animation options. B\u00e9zier IK is a kind of IK controlled by B\u00e9zier functions, similar to B\u00e9zier paths in After Effects; this is especially useful for tails or spines for example, when you want to achieve a smooth curve. B\u00e9zier FK combines a B\u00e9zier IK with FK controls, to be able to animate the IK use the rotation properties of the controllers at each end. You can also set your preference for longer chains made of more than three bones, tails and hair strands.

For all these legs, Duik creates a control at the end (on the foot or hand), and depending on the bones available in the armature (thus depending on how you\u2019ve designed the limb) 3 , some controls for specific joints of the limb are available in the effects of the controller layer. Front legs Back legs Note All tetrapods (four-legged animals) have the same joints on the legs, and although they may seem to be reversed, it\u2019s never actually the case. For example, it may seem that the knee is reversed on wading birds compared to mammals, but the joint we see as the knee is actually the ankle, the knee being hidden higher under the feathers. When rigging legs, Duik creates a single controller with all the detailed controls in its effects. For all legs, there is at least one IK Effect which controls the main part of the limb, and according to the type of animal, the available bones in the limbs, or what was selected when running the auto-rig, there may be other effects to control other joints of the limb. Read the Constraints / Kinematics section for more details about the IK and FK effects. Hominoids and plantigrades A typical plantigrade leg, with all possible joints and bones A typical human arm, shoulder not included A typical plantigrade (bear) front leg, shoulder not included Additionally to the IK controlling the thigh and calf, or arm and forearm parts of the limb, the following effects may be available. Foot roll The foot roll effect is available only if the leg is a standard leg made of two parts (a thigh and a calf). Use this effect to control all possible rotations of the foot, using different anchor points: The Toes angle simply rotates the toes (or claws). The Tiptoe angle rotates the foot from its tip, its very end, like a dancer tiptoeing. The Heel angle rotates the foot from the point of contact between the heel and the ground. The Foot roll angle is a very useful control when animating a walk for example. Negative values rotate the foot the same way as the Heel value, and positive values raise the heel by rotating it around the toe joint, which happens at the end of each step during the walk, when the foot is behind the character, just before it raises to go forward again. Note Some of these controls have a slightly different effect if the toes aren\u2019t separated from the foot, if there\u2019s no joint between the foot and the toes. As all these values rotate (part of) the foot using different pivots, they should never be used at the same time. When one of these values is set, the three other values should always be 0 \u00b0 (the foot can\u2019t rotate using multiple pivots at the same time). Note Rotate the controller itself to rotate the foot from the ankle. Different ways to rotate the foot: Rest pose, Foot rotation (using the controller), Toe angle, Tiptoe angle, Heel angle, and Foot Roll angle. Notice how the three last angles also move the knee. For a precise control of the foot, make sure all joints and bones are perfectly located, especially the toe bone, the tip, and the heel, as shown on the picture above. Tip The Tiptoe , Heel , and Foot roll values all move the knee when they\u2019re animated, and make it difficult to control precisely the movement of the knee and the leg. You should avoid animating them when possible. Shoulder controls The two shoulder effects are available if the limb is an arm or front leg, and a shoulder bone has been included. The IK effect controls the rotation of the shoulder; an automatic rotation occurs when the hand moves, according to the Weight value of this effect. Use the FK value to manually adjust or animate the rotation of the shoulder. The Shoulder position effect controls the position of the shoulder. An automatic translation of the shoulder can be controlled with the Auto effect, but be aware that this movement happens if and only if there\u2019s an actual animation (with keyframes or expressions), and not when just manipulating the controller. Use the Position value to manually adjust or animate the position of the shoulder. Digitigrades A typical digitigrade (cat) back leg Additionally to the IK controlling the thigh and calf, or arm and forearm parts of the limb, the following effects may be available. Foot roll The foot roll effect is available only if the leg is a standard leg made of two parts (a thigh and a calf, or an arm and a forearm) and the toes/claws are separated from the foot (i.e. the toe joint can be rotated). Use this effect to control all possible rotations of the foot, using different anchor points: The Tiptoe angle rotates the foot from its tip, its very end, like a dancer tiptoeing. The Claws angle rotates the fingers or claws. The Foot roll angle is a very useful control when animating a walk for example. It rotates the foot around the fingers/claws joint. As the Tiptoe and Foot roll values rotate (part of) the foot using different pivots, they should never be used at the same time. When one of these values is set, the other value should always be 0 \u00b0 (the foot can\u2019t rotate using multiple pivots at the same time).

Use the Position value to manually adjust or animate the position of the shoulder. Ungulate A typical ungulate (horse) front leg, shoulder not included Additionally to the IK controlling the thigh and calf, or arm and forearm parts of the limb, the following effects may be available. IK | Foot This single-layer IK controls the orientation of the whole foot (including the hoof). Hoof This simple angle controls the rotation of the hoof. It is to be used when the leg is not standing and in contact with the ground. The rotation of the controller itself rotates the foot around the hoof joint, a bit like what the Foot Roll values do with the plantigrade and digitigrade rigs. Shoulder controls The two shoulder effects are available if the limb is an arm or front leg, and a shoulder bone has been included. The IK effect controls the rotation of the shoulder; an automatic rotation occurs when the hand moves, according to the Weight value of this effect. Use the FK value to manually adjust or animate the rotation of the shoulder. The Shoulder position effect controls the position of the shoulder.

Arthropod The arthropod rig, in the current version of Duik, is actually similar to the ungulate rig, and has the same controls and effects. Only the initial locations of the joints and length ratios of the different parts of the limbs differ. Tetrapods are four-limbed vertebrate animals constituting the superclass Tetrapoda. It includes amphibians, reptiles, dinosaurs, birds, mammals and other extinct classes. \u21a9 Arthropods are invertebrates with segmented bodies and jointed limbs.

The 2D camera tool creates virtual 2D multiplane cameras to easily animate all types of camera movements, using only 2D layers 1 . Similarly to the Camera rig 2 , Duik also adds nice camera behaviors to these 2D cameras, to easily simulate real cameras and the way they\u2019re manipulated (hand, shoulder, tripod, etc.). Fleischer Studios\u2019 stereoptical camera, From the patent by Max Fleischer, \u201cArt of Making Motion Picture Cartoons\u201d, 1936, Public Domain. Select the layers corresponding to the background planes. This is optional, if there are no layer selected, Duik creates a default 2D camera. Click the 2D Camera button. Duik creates a controller for the camera, and a null layer for each background plane (or three null layers if there was no layer selected). Selected layers are automatically parented to these null layers. Levels Each null layer controls one plane, one level of the background. In the effect of the null layer, you can adjust the influence of the camera with a simple slider. The Camera Influence , as the name suggests, indicates how much of an impact the camera controller has on that null layer. Camera Influence can be found in the effects of the generated or duplicated nulls. A common use case for these nulls would be to view them as planes, or \u201cdepths\u201d. 0 means the level won\u2019t move at all with the camera. 100 means the level moves exactly at the same speed as the camera. > 100 means the level is \u201ccloser\u201d than the camera and moves faster. < 0 negative values moves the level the other way than the camera; this simulates a camera rotating around a middle point in the set, which would be the level 0 . Tip Let\u2019s say we want to create the illusion of three dimensional space that has a main focus on the objects in the middleground ( mg ). You have a foreground ( fg ) layer, an mg layer, and a background ( bg ) layer. You would parent your mg layer to Level 2 since it is your primary object, the bg to Level 1, and the fg to Level 3. From here, you can set the camera influence of Level 1 ( bg ) to a number with a value lower than 100 (the default is 50 % ) and the camera influence of Level 3 ( fg ) to a value greater than 100 (default: 150 % ). Now when you manipulate the controller, the background will move 50 % that of the mg and the fg will move 50 % more than the mg , giving the illusion of depth/parallax. Warning Duik will create a null called Z along with the 2D Camera, just ignore it and don\u2019t try to modify, duplicate or move it. It\u2019s needed to give the camera control it\u2019s anchor point and some other calculations but you should not have to manipulate it by yourself. If you need more or less layers to control other levels, you can remove or duplicate these null level layers, and just parent the actual background image layers to these null layers. Camera animation and effect An effect on the main camera controller helps you animate the camera, with nice interpolations for a smooth camera move, and advanced behaviors to simulate real cameras. Setup The type of camera and type of motion work similarly to the 3D Camera rig &nbsp 2 . The Type of camera changes the behavior of the camera. With the Fixed camera, there\u2019s no random values at all, the camera perfectly follows the animation keyframes. With the other modes, Handheld , Shoulder , Tripod , Steadicam , Duik adds some handmade, fine tuned wiggling to the motion to perfectly simulate the way the camera is moved by the operator. Depending on the type of camera, there are different degrees of liberty for each axis, both in position and rotation, and their weight may change. Duik takes all of this into account to generate a perfect motion. This option also influences how camera shake is generated, all these types will shake differently, to get the most realistic motion possible. The Type of motion changes the interpolation * and extrapolation * of the keyframes. To generate a perfectly smooth and realistic movement on cameras from your keyframes, Duik uses different interpolation and extrapolation algorithms * , and you just have to set the type of motion you\u2019re animating: Start then stop movement : The camera is still at the beginning of the shot, then starts moving and stops moving before the end of the shot. Start of movement : The camera is still at the beginning of the shot, starts moving, and the shot is cut before it starts to slow down. End of movement : The camera is already moving at the beginning of the shot, slows down and stops moving. Easy-B\u00e9zier interpolation : If you\u2019d like to manually adjust the interpolation, this mode allows for fine tuning while keeping a small number of parameters to set. Linear interpolation : To be used when the movement needs to be very regular, and if the camera is already moving at the beginning of the shot and doesn\u2019t stop at the end of the shot. None (use actual keyframe interpolation) : Deactivates the interpolation by Duik to let you use After Effects keyframe interpolation. With all these types of motion, you can tweak the acceleration or deceleration of the camera with the Easing / Acceleration property. This property can be animated if you wish! The Easy-B\u00e9zier options are available in the end of the effect; they\u2019re similar to the B\u00e9zier mode of the Interpolator 3 . Camera Animation Although you could animate directly the position of the camera controller layer, it should be easier and better to animate only from the effect, where all camera moves can be keyframed. Duik differentiates the translation of the camera, which generate a parallax effect, from the rotation or scale which should not generate any parallax 4 . Of course, you can combine all of them. Position (with a parallax effect) Track left/right : horizontal translation. Pedestal up/down : vertical translation. Dolly in/out : depth translation (the third axis which doesn\u2019t exist in 3D, simulated using the scale of the layers). Rotation (without parallax) Pan left/right : horizontal rotation ( yaw ). Tilt up/down : vertical rotation ( pitch ). Roll : the actual 2D rotation. Scale (without parallax) Zoom in/out : the actual 2D scale. This simulate the animation of the focal length (zoom) of the camera. If you prefer to dolly , with parallax, use the dolly in/out property. Random motion and camera shake According to the type of camera , Duik may add some random motion on top of the keyframe animation, to simulate the corresponding type. You can adjust the amplitude and frequency of this wiggling animation. You can also animate the amplitude of the camera shake to make the camera shake at a specific time, for example as the result of an explosion, of the ground trembling or the wind\u2026 Tip You shouldn\u2019t have to change much the frequency values which should be the same for almost all cameras. As with all other random values, you can change the seed in the advanced section of the effect, to test different versions of the motion (or to make sure multiple controllers use the same seed to generate the same motion). This is the digital equivalent of Disney\u2019s multiplane camera (vertical setup) or the Fleischer Studios\u2019 stereoptical camera (horizontal setup) from the early days of traditional animation. \u21a9 cf. Cameras / Camera Rig . \u21a9 \u21a9 cf. Animation / Tools / Interpolator . \u21a9 That\u2019s how it works in real life; there is no change of perspective with rotations, thus no parallax effect, in an ideal setup where the pivot would be exactly at the center of the censor (and the censor would be infinitely small). As this perfect case scenario is almost impossible, there may be a very small parallax when a camera is panning, which is the result of the censor actually translating a bit too instead of just rotating. \u21a9","title":"2D Camera"},{"location":"guide/camera/camera-2d.html#2d-camera","text":"This video is part of the official comprehensive video course about Duik \u00c1ngela With 2D animation, it is usually easier to animate the positions of 2D layers than to set up a 3D space using cameras to create camera movements.

Selected layers are automatically parented to these null layers.","title":"2D Camera"},{"location":"guide/camera/camera-2d.html#levels","text":"Each null layer controls one plane, one level of the background. In the effect of the null layer, you can adjust the influence of the camera with a simple slider. The Camera Influence , as the name suggests, indicates how much of an impact the camera controller has on that null layer. Camera Influence can be found in the effects of the generated or duplicated nulls. A common use case for these nulls would be to view them as planes, or \u201cdepths\u201d. 0 means the level won\u2019t move at all with the camera. 100 means the level moves exactly at the same speed as the camera. > 100 means the level is \u201ccloser\u201d than the camera and moves faster. < 0 negative values moves the level the other way than the camera; this simulates a camera rotating around a middle point in the set, which would be the level 0 . Tip Let\u2019s say we want to create the illusion of three dimensional space that has a main focus on the objects in the middleground ( mg ). You have a foreground ( fg ) layer, an mg layer, and a background ( bg ) layer. You would parent your mg layer to Level 2 since it is your primary object, the bg to Level 1, and the fg to Level 3. From here, you can set the camera influence of Level 1 ( bg ) to a number with a value lower than 100 (the default is 50 % ) and the camera influence of Level 3 ( fg ) to a value greater than 100 (default: 150 % ). Now when you manipulate the controller, the background will move 50 % that of the mg and the fg will move 50 % more than the mg , giving the illusion of depth/parallax. Warning Duik will create a null called Z along with the 2D Camera, just ignore it and don\u2019t try to modify, duplicate or move it. It\u2019s needed to give the camera control it\u2019s anchor point and some other calculations but you should not have to manipulate it by yourself. If you need more or less layers to control other levels, you can remove or duplicate these null level layers, and just parent the actual background image layers to these null layers.","title":"Levels"},{"location":"guide/camera/camera-2d.html#camera-animation-and-effect","text":"An effect on the main camera controller helps you animate the camera, with nice interpolations for a smooth camera move, and advanced behaviors to simulate real cameras.","title":"Camera animation and effect"},{"location":"guide/camera/camera-2d.html#setup","text":"The type of camera and type of motion work similarly to the 3D Camera rig &nbsp 2 .

Every time you need the value of any property react to the change of any other property, you should be able to use the connector to build the automation. It simply drives a slave 1 property (or several slave properties) according to the values of a master property, a bit like what parenting does with the transformation of layers. A single master property can control many slave properties, but to the contrary of a standard parenting (or using the native expression pickwhip in After Effects), a single slave property can be driven by several master properties. There are multiple ways to achieve that, explained in the end of this section. This video is part of the official comprehensive video course about Duik \u00c1ngela Before the connection All the properties which need to be animated together are prepared using keyframes. There are these keyframes which will be controlled by the master property, a bit like a time-remapping would do. The first step is to animate these slave properties; you can use as many keyframes as you need, and precisely adjust the interpolations * if needed. You just have to make sure all the animations of the slave properties have exactly the same duration; if an animation needs to start after or end before the others, just copy and paste the first or last keyframe so that it starts or ends with a still part. All animations must have the same duration Any property of any type which can be controlled by an expression can be connected using the Connector! Quick Connector The quick connector creates a master slider in the effects of the selected layer, and connects all selected slave properties to this new slider. The movement of the slave properties is controlled by their own keyframes, and can still be adjusted after the connection if needed. In this simple example, the connector effect controls the position and the rotation of the layer. It can be used to quickly animate many properties at once, and make sure all have the same interpolation. As the slider is a simple percentage, it is very easy to animate and set the ease influences and velocities on the keyframes. Tip For example, it is a great way to animate the scale and position of a layer and having these properties perfectly synced, even when using complex B\u00e9zier interpolations with the graph editor. More generally, it is a great way to animate many properties and layers at once, when they need to be synced. To use the quick connector, follow these simple steps: Animate the slave properties , the properties to be controlled, from their initial to final state. You can add as many keyframes as you need, and adjust interpolations too. Select all the properties you\u2019d like to control together. Click on the Connector button. Tip The connector slider being a simple percentage value, it is also easy to connect it to something else and use simple expressions with it. If you need to have the controller in another composition, you can either use the Extract controllers tool from the parent composition, or just copy and paste the controller to the new composition, and link the percentage with an expression, simply using the pickwhip. Read further to learn how to do more advanced stuff with the connector, using the additionnal panel. Edit already connected properties If you need to edit the slave properties after they\u2019ve been connected, here\u2019s what you can do: Deactivate the expressions in the properties you need to edit. Edit the keyframes; you can also add or remove keyframes or adjust the interpolation. Reactivate the expressions. Advanced Connector If you need more advanced connections, you can choose one of the many other ways to connect properties and select or create a master controller. The first step is to get to the settings panel of the connector: either click the settings button or [Shift] + [Click] the connector button. This opens the advanced Connector panel. The bottom line of buttons, Pick texture , Pick audio , Pick control lets you select an existing layer or property to be used as a master controller for your connection, which you\u2019ll connect to all slave properties you\u2019d like to animate together. All other buttons automatically create different types of controllers to be used to control the slave properties. It is advised to add the needed keyframes on the slave properties first, although this could also be done or modified afterwards. Just animate the slave properties as you need them to change when the master property goes from its minimum to its maximum value. You can then select or create the master property and configure the connection. Connection modes With this advanced Connector, there will be three ways to connect three different kinds of slave properties you can control using the Connector. Layer opacities : Lets you \u201cselect\u201d the layers with the master property, i.e. switch their opacities. A few keyframes will be added in the opacity of the selected layers to let the master property \u201cselect and show\u201d the layers, one by one. This is a quick and easy way to set up a selector for a bunch of layers. Properties : Like the quick connector , lets you control any kind of property. It simply connects all the selected properties . The movement of these properties will be controlled by their own keyframes, and can still be adjusted after the connection if needed. Key Morph : Lets you control specific Key Morph keys, and interpolate between them. It automatically sets up the selected Key Morph key effects to control them from the master property. Read the Key Morph section for more details. For each mode, the selection you have to make is different: it\u2019s either some layers, some properties, or some Key effects created by the Key Morph . Pick control To use an existing property or layer as a master controller, first select it and then click on the Pick control button. Properties to be used as master controllers with the connector can be: Any numerical property, with 1, 2, or 3 dimensions (rotation, position, opacity\u2026). A color A dropdown menu (except layer dropdown lists) Note All these properties are actually numerical values: a color is a 4-dimensional numerical value (consisting of the red, green, blue and alpha channels), and dropdown menu values are the indices of the items, which are simple integers. There are also special cases handled automatically; you can also select these: Duik IK effects Duik Slider, 2D-slider, Angle controllers Duik Effectors Duik Expose transform controls When selecting one of these, the connector can automatically pick the right property for you. When you click the Pick control button, the connection settings panel is shown. Connector settings when using a position property as the master property Connector settings when using an IK effect as the master control There you can set a few parameters before finishing the connection. In some cases, you may have to select a specific property as a master property. For example, when using an IK Effect, you can either use the IK Length , the Upper stretch or the Lower stretch values. This is a nice way to connect the bending or stretching of a limb to secondary animations or adjustments. You can choose to connect using the simple Value of the master property, or its Speed (an absolute value) or its Velocity (similar to the speed, but with a sign to know the direction). For multi-dimensional properties, you have to select the axis . You can only connect a single axis at once, but don\u2019t forget you can make multiple connections to connect all axis if needed. The minimum and maximum values define the range in which the master property is going to be animated. Note that the motion of the slave properties is not extrapolated outside of these values. Tip If there\u2019s an animation (using keyframes or an existing expression) on the master property at the time you select it, before opening the connection settings, Duik automatically picks the minimum and maximum values of the existing animation. This makes it very quick to set up the connection: just add a couple of keyframes on the master property to quickly define the minimum and maximum values to be used, and only then click on the Pick control button. You\u2019ll be able to remove these keyframes after the connection\u2019s been made. Once you\u2019re done with these settings, you can finish the connection by clicking one of the three bottom buttons: Layer opacities : a few keyframes will be added in the opacity of the selected layers to let the master property \u201cselect and show\u201d the layers, one by one. This is a quick and easy way to set up a selector for a bunch of layers. Properties simply connects all the slave properties. The movement of these properties will be controlled by their own keyframes, and can still be adjusted after the connection if needed. Key Morph automatically sets up the selected Key Morph keys to control them from the master property. Read the Key Morph section for more details. You can now control all slave properties with the master property. A Connector effect is added on the master layer, to let you change the settings of the connection later if needed. After the connection, you can still adjust the keyframes and interpolation of any slave property. To ease these adjustments, you can disable this connector effect to temporarilly disable the expressions and adjust the keyframes on the slave properties. Warning Unfortunately, because of After Effects, disabling the connector effect is not enough in order to be able to adjust the keyframes on slave B\u00e9zier path properties, you actually need to deactivate the expression.

This video is part of the official comprehensive video course about Duik \u00c1ngela Select the master layer, which has an audio channel. Click the Pick audio button. Select the slave properties. Connect. The connector creates precomposition containing the audio layer to let you configure precisely how the audio will control the slave properties. An audio connector precomposition. This composition shows a black-and-white audio spectrum which you can use to select a specific wavelength to control the slave properties. This composition contains four layers: The layers created by the audio connector. From bottom to top: The bottom layer is the original audio layer. The audio spectrum layer is the layer used to display the spectrum in the viewport. You should not change anything in it and keep it locked. The Ear controller is the layer you can use to select a specific wavelength and volume from the audio spectrum to make the connection. Move this controller over the column corresponding to the wavelength you\u2019d like to select. The Audio effector controller exposes the connector settings in its effects. You can use these values to adjust the audio spectrum display and precisely tweak the audio connection. The audio connector settings. When changing these values, you\u2019ll adjust how the audio spectrum is displayed, thus how the connection is made using the Ear controller location. Tip If you\u2019d like to have multiple connections from the same audio layer, just repeat the process from start, to create another precomposition with a new audio connection. How to connect a single slave property to multiple master properties Sometimes, you\u2019ll need to several master properties to have influence on the same slave property. For example when animating a fake 3D head turn, you\u2019ll probably need to connect the position and scale of some parts of the face to both the X and Y axis of a controller. Depending on the slave property type, there are several ways to connect it to multiple master properties. Layer position, rotation or scale properties In the specific case of transform properties, the easiest way to have multiple connections is to use parenting. Just add a null layer as a parent of the slave layer, and make new connections in the transform properties of this parent layer. Tip From the controllers panel 2 , you can quickly insert a null layer in the hierarchy by selecting the controlled layer and [Ctrl] + [Click] on the Null button (or any other controller shape). B\u00e9zier shapes (masks or shape layers) To rig B\u00e9zier shapes, it\u2019s usually easier to control them using pins 3 . As the pins controlling the B\u00e9zier shape are standard layers, you can then rig them as any other controller, and make multiple connections with the other methods described here. Numerical properties The quickest and easiest way to make multiple connections on any numerical property (angle, position, percent, color\u2026) is to add a List 4 on the property; you can then add as many connections as you need, and even other animations, expressions, or Duik automations\u2026 Examples Adjust the shape of a joint (elbow, knee\u2026) when it bends With the connector, it\u2019s very easy to automate the animation of the shape of an arm, a leg, or any limb, when it moves and bends, for example to adjust the cloths, animate the muscles, or just fix the design of the joint. Animate the controller of the limb, to make it bend. Note that this is easier done in FK than IK. Animate what you need to automate (the B\u00e9zier paths of the shape, the position of some pins, etc.) Select the controller layer (the one with the IK effect) Click the Pick control button in the additional panel of the connector. The connector settings are automatically set for you, using the IK Length , which is the distance between the root and the end of the limb (between the hip and the foot, or the shoulder and the hand for example). This is very handy as it\u2019ll work no matter the orientation of the limb, and also takes the stretch into account, so that you can use the same method and the same connection to also adjust the shape of the limb when it is stretched. Despite its name, it also works when animating using FK . Connector settings when using an IK effect as the master control You can then select the animated slave properties and make the connection. Controlling a head turn Precompose the head if you can. This is not mandatory but helps a lot organizing the layers. Animate the head turn either horizontally or vertically. In the additional panel of the connector, either create a slider , a 2D slider (if you plan to connect the other axis), or pick an existing property you\u2019d like to use to animate the head turn. Select the slave properties you\u2019ve just animated. Connect . If you\u2019d like to also connect the other axis for a complete fake 3D turn, these are the additionnal steps: Animate the other axis of the turn in the head precomposition. Be careful: do not add or replace keyframes on already animated and connected properties. If you need to animate an already connected property, the easiest way is to first add a List 4 . Read the section above about multiple connections for more details. In the additional panel of the connector, either create a new slider , select the 2D Slider you\u2019ve created before, or pick an existing property you\u2019d like to use to animate the head turn. Select the slave properties you\u2019ve just animated. Connect . Tip You can use After Effects keyframe color labels to better identify and select all the keyframes you\u2019re connecting. Create nice visual selectors for layers: phonemes, hand shapes, eye shapes\u2026 With the connector, it is very easy to create nice visual selectors for layers, to select some limb shapes for example. Single Line Create a background for the selector. It\u2019s usually a single layer showing available shapes in line or column, and will be used as a reference for the selector. Cells in the column or line must be perfect squares. Create a controller , which will be moved above the background layer created at the previous step. It can be a border, or a solid color with a reduced opacity or a nice blending mode for example. Make sure the anchor point is centered in this layer. Animate the controller \u2019s position, to make its anchor point go from just before the first cell to just before the last cell. Select the position property of the controller layer. Click the Pick property button in the additionnal panel of the connector. Select the slave layers . Connect to opacities . When animating the selector, go from just before the first cell to just after the last cell. Grid To arrange the available shapes in a grid, the process is almost the same as for a simple line, but using a few precompositions. Precompose (or group if you\u2019re in Photoshop , Illustrator , Krita , The Gimp \u2026) the available slave layers to group them by column . You need one precomposition per column in the controller. Create a background for the selector. It\u2019s usually a single layer showing available shapes in a grid. Cells must be perfect squares. Shapes available for each column must correspond to a column precomposition you\u2019ve made at the previous step. Create a controller , which will be moved above the background layer created at the previous step. It can be a border, or a solid color with a reduced opacity or a nice blending mode for example. Make sure the anchor point is centered in this layer. Animate the controller \u2019s X position, to make its anchor point go from just before the leftmost cell to just before the rightmost cell. Select the position property of the controller layer. Click the Pick property button in the additionnal panel of the connector. Select the X axis in the panel. Select the column precompositions . Connect to opacities . The selector now selects all the shapes from the same column when you move it horizontally. Let\u2019s now make the connection to show the right line when you move it vertically. Animate the controller \u2019s Y position, to make its anchor point go from just before the topmost cell to just before the last cell. If you\u2019ve closed the additiionnal panel of the connector, select again the position property of the controller layer and Click the Pick property button . Select the Y axis in the additional panel of the connector. For each column precomposition: Select all the layers inside the precomposition Connect to opacities . Repeat for all columns. In some cultures, using the master and slave metaphor may seem offending; that\u2019s not the case in France where this is written and developped, and this is the best semantics we\u2019ve found to explain what the connector does, without using the parent-child metaphor which is something different in After Effects. We won\u2019t harm anything else than keyframes. \u21a9 cf. Controllers . \u21a9 cf. Constraints / Pins . \u21a9 cf.

Every time you need the value of any property react to the change of any other property, you should be able to use the connector to build the automation. It simply drives a slave 1 property (or several slave properties) according to the values of a master property, a bit like what parenting does with the transformation of layers. A single master property can control many slave properties, but to the contrary of a standard parenting (or using the native expression pickwhip in After Effects), a single slave property can be driven by several master properties.

The movement of the slave properties is controlled by their own keyframes, and can still be adjusted after the connection if needed. In this simple example, the connector effect controls the position and the rotation of the layer. It can be used to quickly animate many properties at once, and make sure all have the same interpolation. As the slider is a simple percentage, it is very easy to animate and set the ease influences and velocities on the keyframes. Tip For example, it is a great way to animate the scale and position of a layer and having these properties perfectly synced, even when using complex B\u00e9zier interpolations with the graph editor. More generally, it is a great way to animate many properties and layers at once, when they need to be synced. To use the quick connector, follow these simple steps: Animate the slave properties , the properties to be controlled, from their initial to final state. You can add as many keyframes as you need, and adjust interpolations too. Select all the properties you\u2019d like to control together. Click on the Connector button. Tip The connector slider being a simple percentage value, it is also easy to connect it to something else and use simple expressions with it. If you need to have the controller in another composition, you can either use the Extract controllers tool from the parent composition, or just copy and paste the controller to the new composition, and link the percentage with an expression, simply using the pickwhip.

In some cases, you may have to select a specific property as a master property. For example, when using an IK Effect, you can either use the IK Length , the Upper stretch or the Lower stretch values. This is a nice way to connect the bending or stretching of a limb to secondary animations or adjustments. You can choose to connect using the simple Value of the master property, or its Speed (an absolute value) or its Velocity (similar to the speed, but with a sign to know the direction). For multi-dimensional properties, you have to select the axis . You can only connect a single axis at once, but don\u2019t forget you can make multiple connections to connect all axis if needed. The minimum and maximum values define the range in which the master property is going to be animated. Note that the motion of the slave properties is not extrapolated outside of these values. Tip If there\u2019s an animation (using keyframes or an existing expression) on the master property at the time you select it, before opening the connection settings, Duik automatically picks the minimum and maximum values of the existing animation. This makes it very quick to set up the connection: just add a couple of keyframes on the master property to quickly define the minimum and maximum values to be used, and only then click on the Pick control button. You\u2019ll be able to remove these keyframes after the connection\u2019s been made.

Illustration of mechanical arm; Instrumenta chyrurgiae et icones anathomicae Ambroise Par\u00e9, 1564 CC BY 4.0 , Wellcome Library , London. Usually, the most basic rig for any kind of limb is to parent the layers together, from the tip (child, e.g. hand or foot) to the root (parent, e.g. shoulder or hip) of the limb. In this simple case, that\u2019s called Forward Kinematics (FK) * : you just need to animate the rotation of each joint from the root to the tip to animate the whole limb. This is the easiest way to animate a limb, as rotation are simple values, and you just have a single value per joint to animate. This works as long as there is no interaction and constraint between the tip (e.g. hand or foot) with something else which moves differently (or is just static, like the floor in the case of a foot). But if you need to constrain the tip of the limb, or just keep it static while animating the root (e.g. keep the foot still on the ground while moving the hips around), you\u2019ll need another method where you can animate both ends of the limb using their position instead of their rotation. That\u2019s called Inverse Kinematics (IK) * , because to the contrary of the FK, you have to animate the end of the limb and the position value is then automatically converted to rotation values in the reversed order, from the tip to the root of the limb. This makes it a bit more difficult to achieve a nice animation, as you\u2019ll have to take care of the trajectories of the end of the limb, and handle position properties which are multi-dimensional and more complex than simple rotations. Claude Autret \u201cJissse\u201d All rights reserved Note When animating using IK, you have to set the values of the position keyframe and their temporal interpolation * , as you would with FK and rotations, but you also have to manage the spatial interpolation and make sure the limb always follows a curved trajectory (and not straight lines) 1 . With Duik (and the Auto-rig) you can rig limbs in a way to be able to switch at any time between IK and FK according to your needs at the time you\u2019re animating. There are also specific types of IK to ease the animations of longer limbs like horse legs, ant and crab legs or even like hair strands, tails or even spines and long necks. IK and FK creation There are two ways to rig After Effects layers with the different types of Duik IK and FK controls: Using Duik bones and the Auto-rig 2 . Using the Kinematics menu in the Constraints panel. Using this method, you\u2019ll be able to rig any kind of layer. Both methods allow you to customize the type of IK/FK controls which are created by Duik. Duik creates one or several controller layers, according to the type of IK/FK, and adds a few effects on these controllers to adjust the settings and give a more precise control on the limb. Using the Auto-Rig Although the Auto-Rig is a smart tool and will try to do its best no matter what layer you select, it\u2019s better to use it exclusively with Duik bones. Select the bone layers you want to rig. Click the Auto-Rig button. This button is available in the Meta-Rig , Bones and Links and Constraints panels. When using custom bones and for other specific long chains like tails or hair strands, you can choose the type of FK or IK control to use. Read the Bones and Auto-Rig / Auto-Rig section for more details. Using the Kinematics menu This method works with all layers. Parent the layers together, from the tip (child) to the root (parent) of the limb. Create a controller layer 3 if you\u2019d like to use a custom controller. This is optional as Duik will create a controller for you if there\u2019s no controller already available. Click the Kinematics menu and then click the type of IK or FK Control you\u2019d like to use. Different types of IK and FK controls are available. This menu shows the different types of IK and FK Control: Standard IK/FK This is suitable for single-layer, 2-layer and 3-layer chains; some options are available specifically for 3-layer chains, read below for more details. B\u00e9zier IK Although the B\u00e9zier IK can be used for any layer chain, it is especially useful for chains longer than 2 layers. FK with Overlapping animation This is a very handy FK-only control for chains where you\u2019re sure you won\u2019t need IK. B\u00e9zier FK This is a special control based on the B\u00e9zier IK control but rigged in a way you can animate rotations instead of the B\u00e9zier IK controllers\u2019 positions. Standard IK/FK The standard IK and FK control can be used with chains consisiting of one to three layers (plus the tip, like the hand or the foot). It can be used for almost all kind of legs and arms. This video is part of the official comprehensive video course about Duik \u00c1ngela Single-layer chain When used on a single layer, the rigged layer just automatically rotates to always point towards its controller. With this type of IK/FK, you can animate either the position of the controller and the position of the rigged layer (or its parent), or the rotation of the layer itself. This means you can animate both using IK or FK as you wish. If there was a tip layer (e.g. hand, foot\u2026) when rigging the layers, it can be rotated using the controller\u2019s rotation property. The effect on the controller allows you to customize the control. IK : you can disable the IK if needed; this is animatable. Weight : if you set this to a lower value than 100 % , the layer will rotate less than needed to point towards the controller. This is how Duik rigs the automatic rotation of the shoulder when you move the hand for example. FK : use this value to control the rotation of the rigged layer. This is here for convenience, as you could also just animate the actual rotation of the layer. The Limits define bounds for the rotation of the layer. This may be useful to limit the rotation of a shoulder in its natural bounds for example. To help you define these limits, you can use the guides to visualize them. Advanced : Inherit parent rotation : if this is checked, the layer will rotate with its parent rotation. Disabling it makes sure the layer always keeps its own orientation no matter the rotation of its ancestors. Full rotation limit : at some point when you move the controller around, there will be a 360\u00b0 jump in the rotation values of the layer. Check this to set this jump on the other side, 180\u00b0 above. The Data section contains some data needed by Duik to compute the Kinematics. Display : Draw guides : check this if the controller is a shape layer to show some useful guides to setup the IK. The limits will be shown to help you adjust their values. The IK Controller with the guides, showing the limits, and the full rotation limit in red. 2-layer chain This video is part of the official comprehensive video course about Duik \u00c1ngela With two layers, both layer rotations are automated to form a triangle between the two joints and the controller; this is very natural for arms and legs. When animating the position of the controller or the position of the first layer (or any of its parents), the limb rotates and bends automatically. With this IK setup, Duik also controls the position of the limbs to be able to stretch (or shrink) them, and allow for fore-shortening effects for example. If there was a tip layer (e.g. hand, foot\u2026) when rigging the layers, it can be rotated using the controller\u2019s rotation property. Duik also includes nice automations to help the animation using FK and make it even simpler and quicker, although it\u2019s already much simpler than IK animation. All this can be configured and animated in the effect of the controller. IK / FK : you can disable the IK if you need to animate using FK; this is animatable. Weight : this blends the IK and FK animation, allowing for a smooth transition between the two. Setting 0 % actually deactivates the IK. Side : the side of the joint (e.g. elbow or knee) can be controlled with this value. 100 % is on one side, -100 % is the other side. Values in between allow for a smooth transition, to animate a foreshortening or fake 3D rotation of the limb. Auto swing changes the side automatically according to a specific angle. To help you set the limit precisely, you can use the guides to visualize it. FK : To animate using FK, you need to disable the IK (or set the weight to 0 % ) first. You can then animate these rotation values to animate the limb using FK. Parent rotation : if this is checked, the limb will rotate with its parent rotation. Disabling it makes sure the limb always keep its own orientation no matter the rotation of its ancestors. Upper is the rotation of the first layer (the root, e.g. the thigh) Lower is the rotation of the second layer (e.g. the calf) End is the rotation of the layer at the end (e.g. the foot), if any. This layer is not actually a part of the IK/FK setup, but it\u2019s useful to be able to animate it right from this effect. FK Overlap : Instead of animating the two or three FK rotation values manually, this FK with automatic overlapping animation * may help you animate the whole limb with a single value. Overlap : check this to enable the automatic overlapping animation. Animation is the property you can animate to automatically animate the whole limb. This works especially well to animate the arm swinging during a walk cycle for example. Flexibility adjusts the quantity of overlapping animation. It is an arbitrary value. Resistance adjusts the delay between the rotation of each part of the limb. It is an arbitrary value. Stretch : Auto-Stretch makes the limb stretch * if it\u2019s too short to reach the location of the controller. Stretch stretches both the first and second layer of the limb, keeping their relative lengths. Upper stretch stretches the first layer (e.g. the thigh). Lower stretch stretches the second layer (e.g. the calf). The Data section contains some data needed by Duik to compute the Kinematics. Display : Draw guides : check this if the controller is a shape layer to show some useful guides to setup the IK. The Auto swing limit will be shown to help you adjust its values. Tip The data section of the effect exposes useful values to write your own expressions or to be used with the connector for an advanced and more customized rig. Tip You can easily switch between IK and FK animation using the IK/FK Switch 4 tool in the animation panel . The IK Controller with the guides, showing the auto swing limit. 3-layer chain Rigging a limb with three joints (and more) is more complicated than it seems. In two dimensions with only two joints, there are only two solutions to the equation defining the rotations of each part (the middle joint, the elbow or knee, can only be on one of the two sides of the line passing through the first joint and the controller). But with three joints, there\u2019s an infinity of solutions. Apart from this difficulty, if we\u2019d use standard IK for the three joints without more details, that\u2019d mean the animator would not be able to manually adjust each joint if needed. Rigging should ease the life of animators, but never restrain their job. These are the reason why Duik does not include true 3-layer IK, but is able to rig 3-layer chains with better controls and accuracy, combining standard 1-layer and 2-layer IK. There are two possibilities: rigging the first layer with a 1-layer IK and the next two layers with a standard 2-layer IK, or the opposite, starting with the 2-layer IK for the first two layers. With both methods, Duik creates a single controller for both the IK controls, allowing for a very simple animation with just the position of the controller, and all detailed controls gathered in the effects of the controller. You can choose between the two in the additional panel of the IK button. 2+1-layer IK creates a single-layer IK on the first layer and 2-layer IK on second and third layers. This mode works best with crab legs for example, when the rotation of the last layer must be controlled precisely. Animate the position of the controller to animate the whole limb, and its rotation to control the orientation of the last layer (in blue). 1+2-layer IK creates a 2-layer IK on the first and second layers and a single-layer IK on the third. This mode works best with arms and their shoulders for example, where the rotation of the first layer must be controlled separately from the other layers, but can be automated with the 1-layer IK weight. Animate the position of the controller to animate the whole limb, and use the single-layer IK weight to adjust the automatic rotation of the first layer (in blue), or animate its FK value to rotate it manually. Figure 21 from The Kinematics of Machinery. Franz Reuleaux, 1876 Public domain B\u00e9zier IK Bone chains with more than two or three bones are usually used to rig flexible limbs, like tails, spines, long necks or hair strands. In this case, the chain is not animated with separated joints, but all at once as a long curve. There are two options to animate this: Using FK , which is best if the limb is something just hanging (like hair strands or cloth, and tails), attached only on one side. B\u00e9zier IK , which is a special kind of IK you can control with several controllers to define the curve of the limb, as you would for a B\u00e9zier path using points and tangents. This is best if the chain is interacting with something else (attached) on both sides, like the spine, the neck, or the tail of the dog stucked in a door. Ouch. Four layers controlled with B\u00e9zier IK Three controllers are available to animate the limb with B\u00e9zier IK: A Root position controller can be used to move the root of the limb. It is usually parented to the rest of the body (the hips for a tail, the head for hairs, etc.) At the middle, a Curve controller helps you animate the curvature of the limb, using its position value. At the end, the actual IK controller, to move the tip of the limb. There are two effects to adjust some details: On the controller of the end of the limb (the main controller): By default, the layers are aligned on the virtual curve (tangent to the curve). You can uncheck the Auto orient option to animate their rotation manually. Use the Offset to move the layers along the virtual curve. Note that this option is also availabe on each layer individually . On the Curve controller: Uncheck the Draw guides option to hide the dashed line representing the IK. You can check the Show handles option to display secondary controls to adjust the virtual curve more precisely. When showning the curve handles, you can adjust the virtual B\u00e9zier curve very precisely. Double click on the handle to move it around. The optional B\u00e9zier handles are actually groups in the shape layer content of the Curve controller; to animate them, animate the position of these groups. FK with overlapping animation The FK rig is a very simple controller to control all the rotations of a long (or short) chain of bones, either individually or all at once. It was especially made to easily animate tails, cloth, hair strands, scarfs, etc. When animating the whole limb at once with a single value, Duik can automatically handle the detailed animation for you, with an automatic overlapping animation, completely customizable. Claude Autret \u201cJissse\u201d All rights reserved Fish tails are rigged with the FK controls and automatic overlapping animation. Four layers controlled at once with the FK control. To animate the limb, you can just animate the rotation of the controller . Tip When adjusting the start pose of the animation , adding the first keyframe on the rotation of the controller, you\u2019ll also need to adjust the Angle value of the second layer of the chain (in the controller\u2019s effects), to fix the pose. That\u2019s because of the automatic overlapping animation, which can\u2019t control the first pose as it needs animation data to process the angles, and there\u2019s no animation before the first keyframe. For performance reasons, Duik also ignores all keyframes hidden before the start of the composition. To adjust the settings of the automatic overlapping animation, an FK Overlap effect is available on the controller. The Flexibility adjusts the amplitude of the movement of each individual layer in the chain. The Resistance adjusts the time of the overlap. For example, the value will be higher in the water than in the air. You can use the Stretch to adjust the length of the limb. This works well if the layers are linked to puppet pins (using bones and/or Duik pins ). Use the Curve value to adjust the global curvature of the limb. This value should not be animated (use the rotation of the controller for the animation). If the Parent rotation is checked, the limb will rotate with its parent rotation. Use this for a tail for example. Disabling it makes sure the limb always keep its own orientation no matter the rotation of its ancestors. You can use this for a scarf or hair strand for example, so it stays vertical no matter the rotation of the head. You can set limits to bound the rotation of each individual part. This is useful for limbs with a high flexibility or resistance. Finally, one angle control is added for each layer of the controlled chain to allow you to adjust and animate each part individually, like in all standard FK rig. B\u00e9zier FK The B\u00e9zier FK is a specific setup using the standard B\u00e9zier IK as a base and some simple expressions and parenting to be able to animate both using fake FK and B\u00e9zier IK at the same time. This is very useful to animate spines or necks, or any chain which itself has children (like the head for the neck) and when you may need both FK for most of the animation and IK in specific cases. Four layers controlled using B\u00e9zier FK With this B\u00e9zier FK, you have the exact same controls as with B\u00e9zier IK (animate the position of the controllers, controlling the curvature with the controller at the center of the chain), but you can also animate the rotation of the controllers , as you would when using standard FK. In this case, Duik moves the curve controller automatically, and you can adjust this automation using the Auto-Curve effect on the controller at the end of the limb. As the movement of the hand or the foot are actually the result of the rotation of the elbow and shoulder or the knee and hip, they naturally move following smooth curves. That\u2019s not the case by default when animating positions in After Effects, where the trajectory will be a straight line. When animating with IK you\u2019ll have to use the pen tool to adjust the spatial B\u00e9zier interpolation of the position keyframes if you don\u2019t separate the dimensions and handle manually the individual interpolations for each axis. \u21a9 cf.

This makes it a bit more difficult to achieve a nice animation, as you\u2019ll have to take care of the trajectories of the end of the limb, and handle position properties which are multi-dimensional and more complex than simple rotations. Claude Autret \u201cJissse\u201d All rights reserved Note When animating using IK, you have to set the values of the position keyframe and their temporal interpolation * , as you would with FK and rotations, but you also have to manage the spatial interpolation and make sure the limb always follows a curved trajectory (and not straight lines) 1 . With Duik (and the Auto-rig) you can rig limbs in a way to be able to switch at any time between IK and FK according to your needs at the time you\u2019re animating. There are also specific types of IK to ease the animations of longer limbs like horse legs, ant and crab legs or even like hair strands, tails or even spines and long necks.","title":"Inverse and Forward Kinematics (IK / FK)"},{"location":"guide/constraints/kinematics.html#ik-and-fk-creation","text":"There are two ways to rig After Effects layers with the different types of Duik IK and FK controls: Using Duik bones and the Auto-rig 2 .

With this type of IK/FK, you can animate either the position of the controller and the position of the rigged layer (or its parent), or the rotation of the layer itself. This means you can animate both using IK or FK as you wish. If there was a tip layer (e.g. hand, foot\u2026) when rigging the layers, it can be rotated using the controller\u2019s rotation property. The effect on the controller allows you to customize the control. IK : you can disable the IK if needed; this is animatable. Weight : if you set this to a lower value than 100 % , the layer will rotate less than needed to point towards the controller. This is how Duik rigs the automatic rotation of the shoulder when you move the hand for example. FK : use this value to control the rotation of the rigged layer. This is here for convenience, as you could also just animate the actual rotation of the layer. The Limits define bounds for the rotation of the layer. This may be useful to limit the rotation of a shoulder in its natural bounds for example. To help you define these limits, you can use the guides to visualize them. Advanced : Inherit parent rotation : if this is checked, the layer will rotate with its parent rotation. Disabling it makes sure the layer always keeps its own orientation no matter the rotation of its ancestors.

When animating the position of the controller or the position of the first layer (or any of its parents), the limb rotates and bends automatically. With this IK setup, Duik also controls the position of the limbs to be able to stretch (or shrink) them, and allow for fore-shortening effects for example. If there was a tip layer (e.g. hand, foot\u2026) when rigging the layers, it can be rotated using the controller\u2019s rotation property. Duik also includes nice automations to help the animation using FK and make it even simpler and quicker, although it\u2019s already much simpler than IK animation. All this can be configured and animated in the effect of the controller. IK / FK : you can disable the IK if you need to animate using FK; this is animatable. Weight : this blends the IK and FK animation, allowing for a smooth transition between the two. Setting 0 % actually deactivates the IK. Side : the side of the joint (e.g. elbow or knee) can be controlled with this value. 100 % is on one side, -100 % is the other side. Values in between allow for a smooth transition, to animate a foreshortening or fake 3D rotation of the limb. Auto swing changes the side automatically according to a specific angle. To help you set the limit precisely, you can use the guides to visualize it. FK : To animate using FK, you need to disable the IK (or set the weight to 0 % ) first. You can then animate these rotation values to animate the limb using FK. Parent rotation : if this is checked, the limb will rotate with its parent rotation. Disabling it makes sure the limb always keep its own orientation no matter the rotation of its ancestors. Upper is the rotation of the first layer (the root, e.g. the thigh) Lower is the rotation of the second layer (e.g. the calf) End is the rotation of the layer at the end (e.g. the foot), if any. This layer is not actually a part of the IK/FK setup, but it\u2019s useful to be able to animate it right from this effect. FK Overlap : Instead of animating the two or three FK rotation values manually, this FK with automatic overlapping animation * may help you animate the whole limb with a single value. Overlap : check this to enable the automatic overlapping animation. Animation is the property you can animate to automatically animate the whole limb. This works especially well to animate the arm swinging during a walk cycle for example. Flexibility adjusts the quantity of overlapping animation. It is an arbitrary value. Resistance adjusts the delay between the rotation of each part of the limb. It is an arbitrary value. Stretch : Auto-Stretch makes the limb stretch * if it\u2019s too short to reach the location of the controller. Stretch stretches both the first and second layer of the limb, keeping their relative lengths. Upper stretch stretches the first layer (e.g. the thigh). Lower stretch stretches the second layer (e.g. the calf). The Data section contains some data needed by Duik to compute the Kinematics. Display : Draw guides : check this if the controller is a shape layer to show some useful guides to setup the IK. The Auto swing limit will be shown to help you adjust its values.

In two dimensions with only two joints, there are only two solutions to the equation defining the rotations of each part (the middle joint, the elbow or knee, can only be on one of the two sides of the line passing through the first joint and the controller). But with three joints, there\u2019s an infinity of solutions. Apart from this difficulty, if we\u2019d use standard IK for the three joints without more details, that\u2019d mean the animator would not be able to manually adjust each joint if needed. Rigging should ease the life of animators, but never restrain their job. These are the reason why Duik does not include true 3-layer IK, but is able to rig 3-layer chains with better controls and accuracy, combining standard 1-layer and 2-layer IK. There are two possibilities: rigging the first layer with a 1-layer IK and the next two layers with a standard 2-layer IK, or the opposite, starting with the 2-layer IK for the first two layers. With both methods, Duik creates a single controller for both the IK controls, allowing for a very simple animation with just the position of the controller, and all detailed controls gathered in the effects of the controller. You can choose between the two in the additional panel of the IK button. 2+1-layer IK creates a single-layer IK on the first layer and 2-layer IK on second and third layers. This mode works best with crab legs for example, when the rotation of the last layer must be controlled precisely. Animate the position of the controller to animate the whole limb, and its rotation to control the orientation of the last layer (in blue). 1+2-layer IK creates a 2-layer IK on the first and second layers and a single-layer IK on the third. This mode works best with arms and their shoulders for example, where the rotation of the first layer must be controlled separately from the other layers, but can be automated with the 1-layer IK weight. Animate the position of the controller to animate the whole limb, and use the single-layer IK weight to adjust the automatic rotation of the first layer (in blue), or animate its FK value to rotate it manually.

There are two options to animate this: Using FK , which is best if the limb is something just hanging (like hair strands or cloth, and tails), attached only on one side. B\u00e9zier IK , which is a special kind of IK you can control with several controllers to define the curve of the limb, as you would for a B\u00e9zier path using points and tangents. This is best if the chain is interacting with something else (attached) on both sides, like the spine, the neck, or the tail of the dog stucked in a door. Ouch. Four layers controlled with B\u00e9zier IK Three controllers are available to animate the limb with B\u00e9zier IK: A Root position controller can be used to move the root of the limb.

At the end, the actual IK controller, to move the tip of the limb. There are two effects to adjust some details: On the controller of the end of the limb (the main controller): By default, the layers are aligned on the virtual curve (tangent to the curve). You can uncheck the Auto orient option to animate their rotation manually. Use the Offset to move the layers along the virtual curve. Note that this option is also availabe on each layer individually . On the Curve controller: Uncheck the Draw guides option to hide the dashed line representing the IK. You can check the Show handles option to display secondary controls to adjust the virtual curve more precisely. When showning the curve handles, you can adjust the virtual B\u00e9zier curve very precisely. Double click on the handle to move it around.

Claude Autret \u201cJissse\u201d All rights reserved Fish tails are rigged with the FK controls and automatic overlapping animation. Four layers controlled at once with the FK control. To animate the limb, you can just animate the rotation of the controller . Tip When adjusting the start pose of the animation , adding the first keyframe on the rotation of the controller, you\u2019ll also need to adjust the Angle value of the second layer of the chain (in the controller\u2019s effects), to fix the pose. That\u2019s because of the automatic overlapping animation, which can\u2019t control the first pose as it needs animation data to process the angles, and there\u2019s no animation before the first keyframe. For performance reasons, Duik also ignores all keyframes hidden before the start of the composition. To adjust the settings of the automatic overlapping animation, an FK Overlap effect is available on the controller. The Flexibility adjusts the amplitude of the movement of each individual layer in the chain. The Resistance adjusts the time of the overlap. For example, the value will be higher in the water than in the air. You can use the Stretch to adjust the length of the limb. This works well if the layers are linked to puppet pins (using bones and/or Duik pins ). Use the Curve value to adjust the global curvature of the limb. This value should not be animated (use the rotation of the controller for the animation). If the Parent rotation is checked, the limb will rotate with its parent rotation. Use this for a tail for example. Disabling it makes sure the limb always keep its own orientation no matter the rotation of its ancestors. You can use this for a scarf or hair strand for example, so it stays vertical no matter the rotation of the head. You can set limits to bound the rotation of each individual part. This is useful for limbs with a high flexibility or resistance. Finally, one angle control is added for each layer of the controlled chain to allow you to adjust and animate each part individually, like in all standard FK rig.","title":"FK with overlapping animation"},{"location":"guide/constraints/kinematics.html#bezier-fk","text":"The B\u00e9zier FK is a specific setup using the standard B\u00e9zier IK as a base and some simple expressions and parenting to be able to animate both using fake FK and B\u00e9zier IK at the same time.

Four layers controlled using B\u00e9zier FK With this B\u00e9zier FK, you have the exact same controls as with B\u00e9zier IK (animate the position of the controllers, controlling the curvature with the controller at the center of the chain), but you can also animate the rotation of the controllers , as you would when using standard FK. In this case, Duik moves the curve controller automatically, and you can adjust this automation using the Auto-Curve effect on the controller at the end of the limb.

You can increase the Motion Blur Precision if you notice motion blur artefacts, but be careful as this may have a very bad impact on performance. The transformation of the child layer is computed depending on the weights and the transformations of its parent layers from the beginning of the composition. When adding a new parent link, you may set a first keyframe on its weight to 0 % and only raise the weight when you need the child to follow the parent. Warning This constraint must use complex expressions, especially if you need to inherit both the position and rotation. This is a problem regarding the performance; the longer the composition, the longer the time needed to compute the expressions: you should try to use this constraint only in short compositions. If you can, you should use the position or orientation constraints 2 instead, which are much lighter, or deactivate the inheritance of the position or the rotation. Don\u2019t forget you can also just duplicate the child layer to have it parented to different layers and animate their opacities, without using Duik at all.

Tip To improve performance, you can bake the expressions 3 in the position and rotation properties of the child layer once you\u2019re done with the animation.

Duik Pins are the easiest way to rig a character using the After Effects Puppet tool or B\u00e9zier paths; you\u2019ll just need to add Duik pins to the puppet pins or B\u00e9zier paths, and parent them to the armatures like you would for any other layer.

Spatial properties and puppet pins This video is part of the official comprehensive video course about Duik \u00c1ngela You can control any spatial (multi-dimensional) property with pins, and all types of puppet pins. Pins to control: standard spatial property, Puppet position pin, Puppet Advanced pin, Puppet bend pin. Standard pins and Puppet position pins control the location of the property they\u2019re linked to; Puppet bend pins control the rotation; Puppet advanced pins also control the rotation and the scale of the After Effects puppet pin. Tip To parent a (2D) spatial property using a pin to a 3D layer, simply switch the pin to 3D. B\u00e9zier paths This video is part of the official comprehensive video course about Duik \u00c1ngela You can use Duik pins to control all B\u00e9zier paths (masks or shape layers). A B\u00e9zier path controlled with Duik pins. By default, Duik won\u2019t create pins to control the tangents, but the tangents can still be controlled by rotating and scaling the pins for the main points. You can hold the [Alt] key when click the Add Pins button to force Duik to create layers for the tagents instead. These layers are still parented to the main points, so rotating and scaling them still works. By default, these tangents are locked together, but they can be unlocked with a checkbox control in the main point effects. B\u00e9zier path pins and tangent pins can be removed or re-created at any time; this is a way to make the composition lighter with less layers, by using only the needed pins and tangent pins. To re-create a pin for an already rigged B\u00e9zier path, select the corresponding property in the effects of the layer containing the B\u00e9zier path, then click again on the Add Pins button. The effects on the layer containing a rigged path allow you to easily re-create missing pins to control the path, or manually adjust the values. Warning It seems that expressions in the B\u00e9zier path properties of masks are much slower than in path properties of shape layers.

They\u2019re very useful to rig all kinds of machines, cogs, or also cloths, for example when used with puppet pins or B\u00e9zier paths and Duik pins 1 , constrained to the orientation or location of the limbs and joints. Elementary treatise on the finishing of white, dyed, and printed cotton goods Joseph Depierre, 1889 Public domain. Most of the time, the same effect can be obtained with the connector, but with un-bounded values. Using constraints is also easier when there are multiple master layers. Select the layers to constrain then click the Transform\u2026 button to select the constraint to apply to the selection. Tip When a layer is constrained, its rotation and position are not locked; you can still edit and animate them manually and offset the constrained value. Position Constraint You can constrain the position of a layer to the location of other layers; that means the constrained layer will translate according to the absolute location of the other layers, taking all parent translations into account. The weight * acts as a multiplier of the constraint and can be animated. For example, if a layer is constrained to two other layers with both weights at 50 % , it stays in the center of the segment joining the two other layers. That also works with three layers and 33.3 % , to attach the layer to the center of mass of the layers. Of course you can adjust the weights to change the \u201c mass \u201d of the master layers. You can use the effect to adjust and animate the position constraint. Just select the layer to constrain to, and set or animate its weight. To constrain to multiple layers, you can duplicate the effect. Note Because this constraint depends on the specific location of the layers at the beginning of the composition, you won\u2019t see the effect of the position constraint until there\u2019s an actual animation (using keyframes or expressions) on the master layers, and at the very first frame of the composition. Orientation Constraint You can constrain the rotation of a layer to the orientation of other layers; that means the constrained layer will rotate according to the absolute orientation of the other layers, taking all parent rotations into account. The weight * acts as a multiplier of the constraint and can be animated. L\u00e9a Saint-Raymond All rights reserved. This is a very useful tool when you need a layer to stay always aligned with another layer, without translating with it. You can also use this constraint to link the orientation of a controller to the orientation of any layer in the rig, this is a quick and easy way to control rotations in a rig, without parenting. You can use the effect to adjust and animate the orientation constraint. Just select the layer to constrain to, and set or animate its weight. To constrain to multiple layers, you can duplicate the effect. Tip When all orientation constraints are set to 0 % , the constrained layer keeps its own orientation no matter what, even if it has a parent. That\u2019s an easy way to rig the gondolas of a ferris wheel for example, or the pedal of a bicycle. Path Constraint To make a layer follow a B\u00e9zier path (and stay aligned with it), you can use the path constraint. It constrains both the position and the rotation of the layer. Elementary treatise on the finishing of white, dyed, and printed cotton goods Joseph Depierre, 1889 Public domain. Click the Path Constraint button. Select the path property (be careful not to select the group containing the path, but the actual path property). Click the eye dropper button. Select the layer to constrain. Click the Path constraint button. You can [Alt] + [Click] to automatically move the constrained layer to the first point of the path. You can use the effect to adjust and animate the path constraint. You can move the layer along the path with the first percent value; you can easily loop the animation as this value is not limited to 0 - 100 % . You can offset the layer away from the path, along the normal at the corresponding percent along path, with the Path Offset property. By default, the layer is rotated to stay tangent to the path.

The effect is that all of the layer\u2019s transformation values, now given in relation to its zero layer, which is at the same place, are initialized to: [0 px, 0 px] in position, 0\u00b0 in rotation, [100 %, 100 %] in scale. Using zeros on multiple layers, it becomes very easy to link their positions with an expression even if they are not at the same location, and even from one composition to another. Another useful thing is that using zeros makes it easy to recover the original position of a layer, you just have to set all its coordinates to 0 . Adding zeroes to all controllers when rigging a character to be able to retrieve its rest pose is a very common trick. Warning When a zero layer has been added, if you want to change the parent of the layer you\u2019re working with, be careful to change the parent of the zero layer and not the actual parent of the layer itself, to keep the zero layer in the hierarchy.","title":"Zero"},{"location":"guide/controllers/index.html","text":"Controllers This video is part of the official comprehensive video course about Duik \u00c1ngela Using the Auto-rig 1 , and a set of constraints * , what you end up with are controllers * to drive the animation.

In most cases, it is easier to have rigs (for characters or other items) in their own precompositions, but this is not the most handy way to animate, especially when you have several characters in the same shot or if you need to see the background. To avoid assembling all the rigs and the background in the same composition, you can keep the rigs in a precomposition and Extract the controllers. This way, all the controllers are available in the same main composition, with the background if you wish, but the rigs stay precomposed. This is especially useful when there are a lot of layers for the rigs, and if you want to render proxies for character animations in order to improve performance when compositing the shot. All controllers are parented to the precomposition, which makes it easy to move the rig; the precomposition can even be rotated and scaled too. Note You can flip the character with a negative scale value on the horizontal axis. Usage Select the precomposition. Click the Extract button in the Controllers panel . Hint All layers tagged as controllers will be extracted: you can tag your own layers to extract them along with the controllers actually created by Duik. Options You can choose to extract controllers using expressions or Essential Properties . With expressions , the performance is much better , but the precomposed rig can\u2019t be re-used in another composition. You must keep a clean copy of the rig to be able to duplicate it each time you need to animate in a new composition and extract the controllers. With essential properties , there\u2019s no need to keep a copy of the rigged composition: the same composition can be used as many times as you need in the same project, but the performance is worse, and may even be extremely slow. By default, Duik will bake the controllers before extracting them, to improve the performance of the rig during the animation process. This way you can keep the controllers editable in a backup copy of the rigged precomposition, to be able to edit the rig later, but automatically have the best performance when animating after the controller extraction. Recommended workflow To keep the best performance possible, it\u2019s better to always extract controllers using expressions, except in specific cases when there are very few controllers to extract. The more essential properties are created, the worse the performance is. You should always keep your rigs in their own After Effects project files, and then import them in the projects where you\u2019re animating. As soon as you import a specific rig, you should rename its main composition and all precompositions it uses; this is the best way to make sure all composition names are unique and avoid expression errors if you need to import several times the same rig in the same After Effects projet.

With the support of OCO, Duik now also includes a lot of Meta-rigs, predefined armatures you can use to rig an entire character in a few clicks, thanks to the almighty Duik Auto-rig . The Meta-rig Library This video is part of the official comprehensive video course about Duik \u00c1ngela The OCO Panel in Duik is a library of meta-rigs , to help you create armatures for all kind of animals in a single click. These meta-rigs are sorted into categories, corresponding to the type of animals. Each of these meta-rigs has been carefully crafted so that their limbs have realistic proportions and the joints have an optimal location for 2D cut-out animation. That means they can be used both for rigging existing characters or as a reference to design new characters. As they follow the OCO standard, the Duik Auto-rig is able to rig the armatures created using these meta-rigs in a single click and provide all needed controllers for a very easy, though very detailed animation. Creating new armatures To create an armature from an OCO meta-rig, you just have to find it in the library and double click the item or click the apply button. You can filter categories and meta-rigs using the search field on top of the panel. To automatically assign a given name to the new character, you can set its name in the character name field on top of the panel, this name will be used for the creation of the armature. Note The created armatures are using Duik Bones , and all of the bone options and features are available to further customize it 1 . Creation options If you [Shift] + [Click] the apply button, you can set a few options for the creation of the bones. You can change the type of bones to be created: Full Bones are bones with envelops and noodles 1 , if you plan to use all of these bone features. Light Bones are simpler bones with better performance, but without envelops nor noodles or other advanced features. You can show the bone envelops by default. Use this if you\u2019re using the meta-rig as a reference to design a character for example. You can show the bone noodles by default. You can use this to use the meta-rig as a base for designing a simple vector character. Select the Create new composition option to create the new armature in its own dedicated composition. Extending the library You can add your own custom OCO meta-rigs to the library, from any composition containing Duik Bones. You can handle the content of the library with the buttons on the bottom right corner of the panel. Duik will collect all information from the bones in the current composition and export it as a new OCO file stored in the library for future use. When creating the meta-rig, you can include an icon which should be a small PNG file. Set the approximate character height (from its lowest bone to the highest) so that information can be used when creating multiple characters in the same scene and automatically have them approximately at the right size. This height is in centimeters to be independent from the resolution. OCO Files The library is actually just a folder structure containing OCO files, which is by default located in your Documents folder. You can quickly open this folder with the folder button, or set a new folder to be used as the library with [Alt] + [Click] . In this case you must select (or create) an new OCO.config file which will contain all your OCO settings, shared across all applications using OCO and this same config file. Tip You can share this library (just send the files) or even synchronize it across multiple devices using any syncing service or application like Syncthing 2 , Dropbox , OneDrive , etc. Note If you think your shiny brand new OCO Metarig deserves to be officially included in Duik, just send it to us with a friendly message on contact.rxlab.info !

Set the approximate character height (from its lowest bone to the highest) so that information can be used when creating multiple characters in the same scene and automatically have them approximately at the right size. This height is in centimeters to be independent from the resolution.","title":"Extending the library"},{"location":"guide/oco/index.html#oco-files","text":"The library is actually just a folder structure containing OCO files, which is by default located in your Documents folder.

First, this icon was used as a nod to the fact I, the developer of Duik, was always said to be a communist, by my friends and actually all the people I met. The most observant among you will notice the icon is actually a mirrored version of the hammer and sickle communist symbol, and not an exact copy. It is true I believe the class struggle is very real, and capitalism and mercantilism have to end. That\u2019s one of the reason why Duik is free, after all!

Some comments compared the hammer and sickle icon in Duik to the use of the swastika by the Nazis, but there\u2019s nothing comparable here; it\u2019s ignorance which led these people to associate the hammer and sickle to Stalin and Stalinism. It\u2019s ignorance which leads to conflate Stalinism and Communism. Thus using the hammer and sickle communist symbol is not endorsing Stalinism or even Leninism at all. Stalinism, also called Marxism-leninism, was actually state capitalism; this doctrine is far from actual Marxism and Communism, which existed for almost a century before Stalin took power in the Soviet Russia and continued to exist after the fall of the Soviet Union. I believe it\u2019s capitalist propaganda which hammered in people\u2019s education that Stalinism and the Soviet Union are Communism, thus nearly as bad as Nazism.

Although the hammer and sickle became used by the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic in 1924, it was already used before, during the 1917 Russian Revolution. The hammer stands for the industrial working class and the sickle represents the agricultural workers, uniting the two groups, which made sense to represent the working class as a whole during the Russian revolution.

Added new controls and interpolation options for the Swink when it is used on colors. Added color options for the Interpolator. You can now select a better colorspace to use during the interpolation, to have better (brightest) colors in between keyframes. Added the ability to add lists to color properties Performance improvements and options were also added. Added new \u201cLight Bones\u201d ; they can be activated in the bone settings panel or OCO Create Metarig options. Added optional raster (PNG) controllers ; this improves a lot the performance compared to shape layers. The option can be set in the settings panel of the controllers. The bone settings panel can now edit the bone color and opacity even if they\u2019re already baked. The Bake Expression tool has been slightly improved to generate keyframe interpolations closer to the original one in specific cases. This is part of an ongoing work on all keyframe and timeline stuff. Stay in touch! And this version also has introduces many other improvements to make your life easier. Added an Extrapolation weight, a % you can animate to adjust the extrapolation (e.g. start and stop a loopout/in cycle) on the Looper/Interpolator. Added an option to not lock the scale of null controllers by default (so you can use them to quickly scale several layers at once). Added an option to automatically create a root controller in the autorig. Added opacity controls to the pins. Refactored the pin settings panel, which is now similar to other settings panels. Allow negative anticipation in the Kleaner (to simulate some kind of rusty thing, or hesitation when starting a movement) Alt Click the List button to automatically add a keyframe to the second slot (and quickly reveal it with \u2018U\u2019 in the timeline) OCO Update: OCO now uses an \u201cOCO.config\u201d files to share settings and the OCO Library between all applications using OCO, a bit like OpenColorIO config files. OCO is still under heavy development, and many new features will be added in the next months, both in After Effects, Blender and Krita. The \u2018Bug report\u2019 button now redirects to a new and better form on rxlaboratory.org, pre-filled with details about your system. Finally, new OCO metarigs were included: Horse Bear Lemur Tyrannosaurus Scorpion Whale Monkey \u25ba The list of all bug fixes is available here . 17.0 New Features (Auto-)Rigging Note There have been some changes in the way tools are named in Duik \u00c1ngela, compared to Duik Bassel. \u2022 Structures are now named Bones (single item) or Armatures (complete limbs). \u2022 Bones are now named Pins . This changelog and all the documentation now use these new naming. New Auto-rigs : Wings rigging is now a thing. Hair rigging is now a thing. Arthropod leg rigging is now a thing. Fish (fins and spine) rigging is now a thing. New Bones : previously known as Structures, Bones have been redesigned, and new limbs for all kind of animals are available (fish and their fins, snakes, wings\u2026). Note: the bones from the previous versions of Duik are now named Pins . Bones now have optional envelops and noodles . Bone envelops are very useful to design limbs and make sure the joints work well, and combined with the bone noodles they\u2019re a quick way to create and animate customizable limbs in a single click and a few settings. New controller shapes: Vertebrae Rib cage / Torso The Link art button in the bone panel will (try to) automatically parent all artwork layers to their corresponding bones. Constraints The Connector has many new abilities: it can now use the audio from a layer to control properties. it has a new Layer list mode to quicklly connect a bunch of layers to a dropdown menu effect. its UI has been made simpler. New type of IK/FK: B\u00e9zier FK , which is used by the Auto-rig for spine and neck rigging. The Move anchor point tool can move the anchor points of the selected layers to their bounds or center. It works with pixel layers and shape layers, and can use the masks too. It can also take a custom margin into account. This tool is located both the the links & constraints panel and the animation panel. Key Morph : also known as Shape Keys , Pose Morph , Blend Shapes or Morphers in other software, they\u2019re now available in After Effects with Duik, and can be easily connected to nice controllers using the Connector . A property can be connected to a selection of key morphs using the Connector . Note that the master property must use keyframes (it can not be controlled by expressions). UI Tweaks: Kinematics Constraints button: quickly add IK and FK constraints to the layers. Parent Constraints are assembled under the same button group. Tranformation Constraints are assembled under the same button group. 2+1 layer IK is a new way to use IK on a 3-layer chain, which is useful for arthropods and the new way of rigging ungulates. Automation and expressions The Kleaner is back and it\u2019s been completely redesigned. It now uses general intuitive parameters to control the whole animation (like the size, weight, friction, etc.), but you still can fine-tune it with more detailed and advanced parameters. It is now able to correctly handle easing, anticipation and follow through on spatial properties without separating the dimensions. In this case, just use roving keyframes when the layer is moving, and keep linear keyframes when it stops. The Kleaner will precisely follow the trajectory while handling the speed. Ease is automatically computed for the motion to be as smooth as possible. If you want to stop at a specific keyframe, switch it to maintain . The overlap (and soft body simulation) has been improved a lot: the animation is better and smoother, and performance is a bit better. It now has (soft) limits too! The Walk Cycle is now also a Run Cycle . Its controls and performance have been greatly improved. The Swink tool replaces the previous Swing and Blink tools. It makes a property regularly switch between two values, with advanced options to manage the frequency and interpolation between the two. The frequency of the Swink can be animated. The Random automation can be used when a property needs to be completely randomized; e.g. when a Wiggle automation is too smooth. The Bake expressions tool is able to bake selected expressions or the whole project expressions to keyframes. It comes with two algorithms: a precise algorithm which adds a keyframe per frame (or less, according to the precision factor you can set), and a smart algorithm which automatically adds as less keyframes as possible, and the resulting keyframes are easy to edit. The Bake Composition tool bakes all expressions in the comp (or on selected layers), and removes all non-renderable layers (guide layers, nulls, etc.). If a renderable layer was parented to a non-renderable one, its transformation properties are baked to keyframes. Edit Expression in the Automation and Tools panel opens the selected expression in your favorite external editor to edit them more easily, then reloads them in the After Effects properties when you\u2019ve finished editing them. Expression tools : various useful tools to fix and work with expressions (in the automation panel toolbar). Animation New Non-linear Animation (NLA) tool replaces the previous Animation Blender tool. It is a great and very easy way to edit animations as you would do with video clips in a Non-linear video editor like Adobe Premiere . A Tweening section in the animation panel helps you tween your animation, if you\u2019re working with hold keyframes before going to curves for example (using the Kleaner or not). Includes three new tools: Tween Slider : adds a new in-between to the current time, according to a ratio between the previous and next pose. Split Keyframes : splits the selected keyframes into couples of keyframes with the same values (freezing the pose for a predefined time). Freeze pose : freezes the previous (or next) pose up to the current time (copies the previous or next keyframe to the current time). Sync Keyframes moves all selected keyframes to the current time. If multiple keyframes in the same property are selected, they\u2019re offset to the current time, keeping the animation. Snap Keyframes snaps the keyframes to actual frames if they\u2019re in between (like it happens when changing the duration of an animation or the framerate of a comp). The Sequencer distributes your layers or keyframes in time. New Interpolator tool (animation panel). The Interpolator is a tool to help you.... Interpolate keyframes. It\u2019s a bit like the Kleaner but on a low-level where you can really choose and tweak how the animation is interpolated, for more advanced users. It includens extrapolation methods to loop in or out, with different modes: constant, continue, ping pong, cycle, bounce, follow-through. When an extrapolation is animated, for example when stopping a loop, the property now stays at the right value. It is able to extrapolate motion (loops) in between keyframes if the property is still. Quickly save, export, import, apply animations with the new Animation library (animation panel). Tools DuCop (Duduf Comp Parameters) is now included in Duik (Tools/Composition panel). It enables you to change the composition settings of all selected compositions including their precompositions. It will also adjust the duration and size of any layer which should match the new composition duration and size if it\u2019s changed. Use Crop precompositions to\u2026 crop precompositions. The tool uses the mask(s) found on the precomposition layer to crop the source composition: just draw a quick mask on the layer then click on the button to crop the composition, without moving any of the layers using the same source composition. The Layer Manager will help (re)naming layers and setting useful tags for rigging and grouping layers. The Note panel can now also save composition-specific or project-specific notes. These notes are savec in the project file. The Script library helps you sort all your scripts. From there, you can easily access, edit, and launch your installed scripts and dockable panels, or any other stand-alone script. The Script editor is a basic script to let you edit and run simple scripts. But even if it\u2019s basic, it includes the whole Duik API to easily use Duik\u2019s advanced functions in a few simple lines. Miscellaneous New User Interface : Along with a complete code refactor, Duik underwent a complete UI redesign. Performance (loading time) has been improved, Duik now fits better in the interface of After Effects, it is more discreet and let you focus on your work. Complete code refactor : Duik is easier to maintain, code is better organizezd, performance has been improved\u2026 A progress bar is available at the bottom of the panel to show the current funding status\u2026 We\u2019ve finally dropped support of After Effects CS6 , sorry, it was too much work to keep compatibility for too few users. CS6 ( v11.0.2 ) dates back to October 2012, it\u2019s time to update! Duik should now work on all versions of After Effects starting with After Effects CC ( v12.0 , July 2013). Improvements (Auto-)Rigging Performance has been improved for almost all of the tools and expressions. Legs : The Foot Roll performance has been improved (a lot) with a simpler rig. Ungulate leg rigs have been changed to be closer to the actual anatomy of the animals you eat (cattle, cute lambs, horses\u2026) The Spine Auto-Rig has been tweaked to better handle some special cases and globally improve controls over the spine and the torso. Tails and all FK with overlap are now stretchy! Show/Hide bones and controllers : [Alt] + [Click] to show/hide only the unselected layers. IK/FK : The 3-layer IK has been removed from Duik as it wasn\u2019t used, and could easily be replaced by the better 2+1 or 1+2 IK. Added a Weight slider to the 2-layer and 3-layer IK to be able to progressively transition between IK and FK (this may be useful with the new Non-Linear Animation and Animation Library ). Removed Advanced / Full rotation limit option from the IK effects. One-layer IK now have optional limits, with a softness parameter. Two-layer IK sides can now be switched progressively, and an auto-swing option can automate reversing the joint. Bone and controller sizes are now responsive to the composition size (if the\u2019re not baked) Constraints The Connector can now connect both velocities or speed. Pins on shapes: added a \u201cLock tangent\u201d button in the effects of the vertex layers. The performance of the Parent Constraint has been greatly improved. Note that expressions in the weight properties may not work correctly, you may have to bake them to keyframes (for example using the new Bake expressions tool from Duik). Locators (used by Parent Across comps ) are now created at the bottom of the layer stack. Path Constraint : [Alt] + [Clic] to move the layer to the first point of the path. Lists can now be simply duplicated to get more tracks. Property Info now shows keyframe information. Automation and expressions Wiggle : The Wiggle can now optionally use a different seed for each controlled layer. The frequency of the Wiggle can now be animated. The initial random seed is better chosen. The Effector now also works with custom shapes ! (in addition to the circle and the line). The Randomizer now has the ability to generate random values distributed along a Gaussian bell-shaped function for a more natural result. The Motion Trail parameters have been improved, and it is now able to use the taper parameters from After Effects >= 17.1. The Wheel automation has a new Straight option for wheels moving along a non-horizontal straight line, which improves performance for this specific case compared to the Curved option. The Looper now uses the new Interpolator tool. Renamed Separate dimensions to Split values . Animation Copy animation : [Alt] + [Click] to cut the keyframes. The IK/FK Switch tool now works better with controllers which have a combination of 1-layer and 2-layer IK (like an arm and its shoulder). Cameras The 2D Multiplane Camera tool is now better organized, with a single camera controller on top of all levels. The Camera rig now includes advanced behaviours like the 2D Multiplane Camera already did. Both the Camera rig and the 2D Multiplane Camera now automatically handle motion interpolation for perfect and smooth camera movements. Tools You can now Search and Replace in effect names too. Miscellaneous Rename : when renaming puppet pins, just select a single layer to rename all puppet pins found on it, no need to select the pins individually anymore. Sanity tests : The Sanity tests have been improved to work more efficiently. The After Effects up time is now checked, as After Effects has memory leaks and needs to be restarted every few hours to keep the memory consumption and performance optimal. Improved performance. Some tests may be paused when the project is too big; they can still be run manually. Scriptify Expression tool now creates a variable according to the property name, converted to camelCase. Fixes Fixed glitching issues hapenning sometimes with IK when they\u2019re stretched. The Scale Z-Link now works correctly when the camera is locked. The Camera rig tool no longer fails with one-node cameras, but shows a user-friendly alert. Copy / Paste Animation and the Animation Library now handle text keyframes. Copy / Paste Animation now correctly selects missing layers. Edit Mode now works correctly with locked child layers. Controller extraction is now faster and more reliable on After Effects > 22.0. Pins now work better with 3D layers.","title":"Changelog"},{"location":"misc/changelog.html#duik-angela-17-changelog","text":"This is the list of what has changed since the previous major version of Duik ( Duik Bassel, 16.2 ). \u25ba The detailed list of changes of minor versions of Duik is available here .","title":"Duik \u00c1ngela (17) Changelog"},{"location":"misc/changelog.html#171","text":"This new version of Duik \u00c1ngela introduces important features to help color animation, which may be extended later into more features or tools in another dedicated tool set. Added new controls and interpolation options for the Swink when it is used on colors. Added color options for the Interpolator. You can now select a better colorspace to use during the interpolation, to have better (brightest) colors in between keyframes. Added the ability to add lists to color properties Performance improvements and options were also added. Added new \u201cLight Bones\u201d ; they can be activated in the bone settings panel or OCO Create Metarig options. Added optional raster (PNG) controllers ; this improves a lot the performance compared to shape layers. The option can be set in the settings panel of the controllers. The bone settings panel can now edit the bone color and opacity even if they\u2019re already baked. The Bake Expression tool has been slightly improved to generate keyframe interpolations closer to the original one in specific cases. This is part of an ongoing work on all keyframe and timeline stuff. Stay in touch! And this version also has introduces many other improvements to make your life easier. Added an Extrapolation weight, a % you can animate to adjust the extrapolation (e.g. start and stop a loopout/in cycle) on the Looper/Interpolator. Added an option to not lock the scale of null controllers by default (so you can use them to quickly scale several layers at once). Added an option to automatically create a root controller in the autorig. Added opacity controls to the pins. Refactored the pin settings panel, which is now similar to other settings panels. Allow negative anticipation in the Kleaner (to simulate some kind of rusty thing, or hesitation when starting a movement) Alt Click the List button to automatically add a keyframe to the second slot (and quickly reveal it with \u2018U\u2019 in the timeline) OCO Update: OCO now uses an \u201cOCO.config\u201d files to share settings and the OCO Library between all applications using OCO, a bit like OpenColorIO config files. OCO is still under heavy development, and many new features will be added in the next months, both in After Effects, Blender and Krita. The \u2018Bug report\u2019 button now redirects to a new and better form on rxlaboratory.org, pre-filled with details about your system. Finally, new OCO metarigs were included: Horse Bear Lemur Tyrannosaurus Scorpion Whale Monkey \u25ba The list of all bug fixes is available here .","title":"17.1"},{"location":"misc/changelog.html#170","text":"","title":"17.0"},{"location":"misc/changelog.html#new-features","text":"","title":"New Features"},{"location":"misc/changelog.html#auto-rigging","text":"Note There have been some changes in the way tools are named in Duik \u00c1ngela, compared to Duik Bassel. \u2022 Structures are now named Bones (single item) or Armatures (complete limbs). \u2022 Bones are now named Pins . This changelog and all the documentation now use these new naming. New Auto-rigs : Wings rigging is now a thing. Hair rigging is now a thing. Arthropod leg rigging is now a thing. Fish (fins and spine) rigging is now a thing. New Bones : previously known as Structures, Bones have been redesigned, and new limbs for all kind of animals are available (fish and their fins, snakes, wings\u2026). Note: the bones from the previous versions of Duik are now named Pins . Bones now have optional envelops and noodles . Bone envelops are very useful to design limbs and make sure the joints work well, and combined with the bone noodles they\u2019re a quick way to create and animate customizable limbs in a single click and a few settings. New controller shapes: Vertebrae Rib cage / Torso The Link art button in the bone panel will (try to) automatically parent all artwork layers to their corresponding bones.","title":"(Auto-)Rigging"},{"location":"misc/changelog.html#constraints","text":"The Connector has many new abilities: it can now use the audio from a layer to control properties. it has a new Layer list mode to quicklly connect a bunch of layers to a dropdown menu effect. its UI has been made simpler. New type of IK/FK: B\u00e9zier FK , which is used by the Auto-rig for spine and neck rigging. The Move anchor point tool can move the anchor points of the selected layers to their bounds or center. It works with pixel layers and shape layers, and can use the masks too. It can also take a custom margin into account. This tool is located both the the links & constraints panel and the animation panel. Key Morph : also known as Shape Keys , Pose Morph , Blend Shapes or Morphers in other software, they\u2019re now available in After Effects with Duik, and can be easily connected to nice controllers using the Connector . A property can be connected to a selection of key morphs using the Connector . Note that the master property must use keyframes (it can not be controlled by expressions). UI Tweaks: Kinematics Constraints button: quickly add IK and FK constraints to the layers. Parent Constraints are assembled under the same button group. Tranformation Constraints are assembled under the same button group. 2+1 layer IK is a new way to use IK on a 3-layer chain, which is useful for arthropods and the new way of rigging ungulates.","title":"Constraints"},{"location":"misc/changelog.html#automation-and-expressions","text":"The Kleaner is back and it\u2019s been completely redesigned. It now uses general intuitive parameters to control the whole animation (like the size, weight, friction, etc.), but you still can fine-tune it with more detailed and advanced parameters. It is now able to correctly handle easing, anticipation and follow through on spatial properties without separating the dimensions. In this case, just use roving keyframes when the layer is moving, and keep linear keyframes when it stops. The Kleaner will precisely follow the trajectory while handling the speed. Ease is automatically computed for the motion to be as smooth as possible. If you want to stop at a specific keyframe, switch it to maintain .

PREAMBLE The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other functional and useful document \u201cfree\u201d in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by others. This License is a kind of \u201ccopyleft\u201d, which means that derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free software. We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference. 1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work under the conditions stated herein. The \u201cDocument\u201d, below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as \u201cyou\u201d. You accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law. A \u201cModified Version\u201d of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another language. A \u201cSecondary Section\u201d is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document\u2019s overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them. The \u201cInvariant Sections\u201d are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none. The \u201cCover Texts\u201d are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words. A \u201cTransparent\u201d copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that is not \u201cTransparent\u201d is called \u201cOpaque\u201d. Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output purposes only. The \u201cTitle Page\u201d means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, \u201cTitle Page\u201d means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work\u2019s title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text. The \u201cpublisher\u201d means any person or entity that distributes copies of the Document to the public. A section \u201cEntitled XYZ\u201d means a named subunit of the Document whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as \u201cAcknowledgements\u201d, \u201cDedications\u201d, \u201cEndorsements\u201d, or \u201cHistory\u201d.) To \u201cPreserve the Title\u201d of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a section \u201cEntitled XYZ\u201d according to this definition. The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License. 2. VERBATIM COPYING You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3. You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly display copies. 3. COPYING IN QUANTITY If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document\u2019s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects. If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages. If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general network-using public has access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public. It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document. 4. MODIFICATIONS You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version: A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that version gives permission. B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you from this requirement. C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the publisher. D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document. E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices. F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below. G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document\u2019s license notice. H. Include an unaltered copy of this License. I. Preserve the section Entitled \u201cHistory\u201d, Preserve its Title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section Entitled \u201cHistory\u201d in the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence. J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on. These may be placed in the \u201cHistory\u201d section. You may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission. K. For any section Entitled \u201cAcknowledgements\u201d or \u201cDedications\u201d, Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein. L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles. M. Delete any section Entitled \u201cEndorsements\u201d. Such a section may not be included in the Modified Version. N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled \u201cEndorsements\u201d or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section. O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers. If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version\u2019s license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section titles. You may add a section Entitled \u201cEndorsements\u201d, provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties\u00e2\u20ac\u201dfor example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard. You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one. The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version. 5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers. The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work. In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled \u201cHistory\u201d in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled \u201cHistory\u201d; likewise combine any sections Entitled \u201cAcknowledgements\u201d, and any sections Entitled \u201cDedications\u201d. You must delete all sections Entitled \u201cEndorsements\u201d. 6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects. You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document. 7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an \u201caggregate\u201d if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation\u2019s users beyond what the individual works permit. When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document. If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire aggregate, the Document\u2019s Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate. 8. TRANSLATION Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this License, and all the license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include the original English version of this License and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the translation and the original version of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail. If a section in the Document is Entitled \u201cAcknowledgements\u201d, \u201cDedications\u201d, or \u201cHistory\u201d, the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual title. 9. TERMINATION You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation. Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice. Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does not give you any rights to use it. 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. See https://www.gnu.org/licenses/ . Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License \u201cor any later version\u201d applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this License can be used, that proxy\u2019s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Document. 11. RELICENSING \u201cMassive Multiauthor Collaboration Site\u201d (or \u201cMMC Site\u201d) means any World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works. A public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server. A \u201cMassive Multiauthor Collaboration\u201d (or \u201cMMC\u201d) contained in the site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC site. \u201cCC-BY-SA\u201d means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco, California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license published by that same organization. \u201cIncorporate\u201d means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or in part, as part of another Document. An MMC is \u201celigible for relicensing\u201d if it is licensed under this License, and if all works that were first published under this License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008. The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing. ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of the License in the document and put the following copyright and license notices just after the title page: Copyright (C) YEAR YOUR NAME. Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3 or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation; with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.

If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the situation. If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit their use in free software.","title":"Documentation license"},{"location":"misc/doc-license.html#gnu-free-documentation-license","text":"Version 1.3, 3 November 2008 Copyright (C) 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc. https://fsf.org/ Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.","title":"GNU Free Documentation License"},{"location":"misc/doc-license.html#0-preamble","text":"The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other functional and useful document \u201cfree\u201d in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by others. This License is a kind of \u201ccopyleft\u201d, which means that derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free software. We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.

PREAMBLE"},{"location":"misc/doc-license.html#1-applicability-and-definitions","text":"This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work under the conditions stated herein. The \u201cDocument\u201d, below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as \u201cyou\u201d. You accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law. A \u201cModified Version\u201d of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another language. A \u201cSecondary Section\u201d is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document\u2019s overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them. The \u201cInvariant Sections\u201d are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none. The \u201cCover Texts\u201d are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words. A \u201cTransparent\u201d copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that is not \u201cTransparent\u201d is called \u201cOpaque\u201d. Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output purposes only. The \u201cTitle Page\u201d means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, \u201cTitle Page\u201d means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work\u2019s title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text. The \u201cpublisher\u201d means any person or entity that distributes copies of the Document to the public. A section \u201cEntitled XYZ\u201d means a named subunit of the Document whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as \u201cAcknowledgements\u201d, \u201cDedications\u201d, \u201cEndorsements\u201d, or \u201cHistory\u201d.) To \u201cPreserve the Title\u201d of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a section \u201cEntitled XYZ\u201d according to this definition. The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License.","title":"1.

You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.

Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects. If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages. If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general network-using public has access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public. It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.","title":"3.

In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version: A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that version gives permission. B.

Fixed Duik storing settings in a wrong folder if the default one has been changed. 16.2.27 Fixes The \u201cFix Unused comp\u201d blocking popup has been removed. Disabled the corresponding live-fix option in the Sanity Tests 16.2.26 Fixes Fixed a bug in the sanity tests initialization preventing Duik from correctly launching ( error at line 38454 ). 16.2.25 Improvements Added useful options to the Sanity checks , along with new quick ways to fix detected issues. Fixes Parenting across comps now takes the time offset of the precomposed layer into account. 16.2.24 Fixes Added an alert when Scale Z-Link is used without camera. Fixed the duplicatedNames[name] is undefined error. Raised the limits of the Zoom and Truck properties in the 2D Camera effect. 16.2.23 Fixes Fixed Sanity checks with locked layers freezing Duik and other issues with layers sharing the same names. 16.2.22 Fixes Fixed the bug preventing Duik from launching correctly through the File/Scripts/Run Script File menu entry. Fixed the too small help panel size in some specific cases. Unfortunately, we cannot restore the resizeable behaviour from previous versions due to some limitations and bugs in the scripting API of After Effects. 16.2.21 Fixes Fixed the Kleaner on non-spatial multi-dimensional properties (like scale). 16.2.20 Fixes Fixed the settingsFile is undefined error on fresh installation. Fixed the additional panels (popups) being hidden after a short period of time. Fixed the Object is Invalid error at line 134XX. The 2D Multiplane Camera now correctly creates the controllers even if a single layer is selected. 16.2.19 New Sanity checks Improvements Improved the performance of the Kleaner by 20-25%. Fixes Fixed controller extraction when some locators have been rigged/animated and don\u2019t have their default expression. Fixed additional panels not showing up on CS6. Fixed the list of commands in Duik cmd being instantly hidden. 16.2.18 New New translation: \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 A tool to automatically switch between thisComp and comp(\"Name\") in expressions. Improvements Updated some translations: Espa\u00f1ol, Fran\u00e7ais, \u4e2d\u6587 Fixes The popups don\u2019t show up outside of the screen anymore when invoked from the right or bottom edge. 16.2.17 Fixes The units in the UI of the Connector are now correctly displayed. The values of the 2D Camera effect are no longer multiplied by the expressions. Fixed broken Connectors when applied to a controller which is then extracted. When creating leg Structures, \u201cheel\u201d is now correctly translated into available languages. 16.2.16 Fixes Fixed the IK/FK Switch with extracted controllers still not working in specific cases. 16.2.15 Fixes Fixed the IK/FK Switch with extracted controllers. The bones are now correctly created with the advanced engine and 3D layers. Improvements The scale of the Effector layer is now taken into account to compute the effect. The path constraint handles a bit better the parenting of the layers. The way the expressions are built internally has been changed to ease future improvements in Duik. This should not change anything for the user, but as it\u2019s an important change, it\u2019s worth knowing and may temporarily introduce some bugs. 16.2.14 Fixes Fixed the Animation Blender tool for animators not working with compositions imported from another project. Be careful with composition names in this case! Fixed the Spring/Kleaner not working on some specific properties, like the strength of the TextEvo effect. The Get button in the controller edit panel does not change the size of the selected controllers anymore. Fixed the Auto-rig freezing in some specific cases (leg with a hoof but no foot). The Auto-rig now moves the controllers to the top of the composition even if they\u2019re nulls. Duik no longer crashes when trying to change the appearance of baked Structures. 16.2.13 Fixes Fixed Controller extraction used with parent accross comps failing in specific cases. The Parent constraint now correctly adds the expression in the Z Position of 3D Layers with dimensions separated. The Orientation constraint does not throw an expression error with the legacy engine anymore. 16.2.12 Fixes Fixed Parent constraint offset on some frames. Fixed Kleaner expression error introduced in 16.2.11 Fixed Motion Trail taper expression error introduced in 16.2.11 Fixed a few other minor issues. 16.2.11 New Parent accross comps now handles scale too. Fixes Fixed Controller extraction and Parent accross comps with (negative) scale values. Fixed multiple Controller extraction (controllers extracted twice or more) in specific cases of inter-dependencies. Fixed 2D Camera position not using the exact keyframe values. Fixed adding keys using the animation panel: now respects the all layer/selected layers option, and works with layers having markers. You can now use values lower than 1 for the width of motion trails 16.2.10 Fixes The Wheel automation now works correctly with negative scales Improved Esperanto, French and Spanish translations. 16.2.9 New Duik is now available in Esperanto too. Fixes Fixed the auto-rig freezing when rigging (at once) tail structures and spine structures without hips. Properly centered the auto-rig button on the Structures panel in Expert and God modes. Parent accross comps now works when the child layer is locked. The Time Remap tool now takes the layer in point into account. 16.2.8 Improvements When using the Kleaner through the Spring button, the Spatial Options are set to Basic instead of Simulated by default, in order to improve performance. The Auto-Parent tool now parents only orphans whith [Alt + Click]. Fixes Fixed an issue where controllers would not be linked properly after extraction (happened when some controllers were duplicated layers). 16.2.7 Improvements [Alt] + [Click] on the remove expressions button now removes expressions keeping the pre-expression value (instead of post-expression value by default) Fixes Fixed a bug where the auto-rig would freeze when rigging arms with hooves. Controller as nulls are now created as 3D layers on Cameras and Lights too. The blink automation no longer generates an expression error when the frequency is set to 0. Controller extraction now works correctly when controllers have zeroes and using master properties instead of expressions. Some issues when parenting accross compositions using master properties are fixed as well. Rigging and ungulate front leg without hoof now works correctly. Rigging a spine when set to use null layers for controllers no longer fails. 16.2.6 Improvements Tagging layers as controllers now automatically sets them to guide layers. Fixes Fixed a bug with bones set on a B\u00e9zier path on a shape layer with the legacy extendscript expression engine. Fixed a few minor bugs concerning layer parenting. 16.2.5 Improvements It is now safe to extract controllers from a duplicated rigged character, even if its controllers have already been extracted in the same composition. Holding Ctrl ] when creating [Controllers, the new controllers is now inserted in the hierarchy (i.e. the layers are parented to the controllers, and the controllers are parented to the previous parents of the layers). When extracting locators and parenting accross compositions it is now possible to use master properties (if the parent is in a precomposition, not in a \u201cparent\u201d composition). Duik will select master properties by default if the version of After Effects is more recent than 17.0. Added new Controller shapes, especially for the face. Controller icons can now be flipped (see the effect of the controller). French and Spanish translations have been completed and improved. Fixes When extracting controllers using master properties, controllers with a parent which is something else than another controller are now correctly linked. Bones are now correctly aligned to shapes inside shape layers when the containing group(s) transformation is not 0. 16.2.4 Improvements The Kleaner now generates very nice animation when the Bounce option is checked in the Follow through section. Bounces are more realistic, but it\u2019s not a real simulation: they are synchronized to the actual frames of the composition so that you always see the contact, and bounces which would be shorter than two frames are \u201csnaped\u201d to the frames anyway. This is animation! Fixes Error at line 2514 and similar errors with the \u201cDuTranslator tr()\u201d function should not happen anymore (unless the dev&debug mode is activated). Structures are now correctly duplicated using the Duplicate tool. 16.2.3 Improvements The UI for the Connector has been simplified in rookie and standard modes. The Kleaner generates a better overlap and soft-body simulation. Flexibility setting improved. The UI for the settings has been improved a bit. Fixes The Spring tool now assigns correct default values when applied to multiple layers at once. Fixed the Kleaner / Spring with 3D Layers and the legacy extendscript expression engine. Fixed the layer stopping on the last keyframe when the Kleaner is used on a position property. Improved the Kleaner performance when used in a position. Improved the Kleaner when the \u201cauto-orient to path\u201d option is turned on for the layer. Fixed Controller extraction issues, especially retro-compatibility with older versions of Duik. Fixed the Connector auto-dectection of min and max values with an IK controller. Fixed the Error at line 2514 (incorrect translation arguments). 16.2.2 Improvements The system used to display the news has been improved for better performance and better UI. Fixes Added a workaround for an After Effects bug in 17.0.0 (2020): when controller are extracted using master properties, a keyframe is added on the master property (only for this specific version of After Effects ), which fixes the controllers not rotating correctly. Fixed the undo history when using the Kleaner / Spring . Greatly improved the Pick Master Property button performance in the Connector . Greatly improved the Get Property Info tool performance. Fixed the head controller created with the auto-rig not linked to the head of the correct composition if the composition is duplicated. Fixed the options for the extract controllers tool not restored correctly (use master properties or expressions). 16.2.1 Improvements The Kleaner now has soft body and overlap options, for spatial properties, in simulation mode. The I/O tab has been removed. You can now import and export animations from the Tools tab. For other software (Storyboarder, Krita, TVPaint), a new free script will be available shortly on rainboxlab.org. The UI has been improved a bit (especially the popups). When creating a [ Controller ] as a null layer, it better detects if it should be 3D, and is placed just on top of the topmost layer. Updated the French and Spanish translations. Fixes Fixed the Kleaner / Spring for non-spatial multi-dimensionnal properties (like scale). Fixed the Kleaner / Spring not working in simulation mode if the property doesn\u2019t have at least two keyframes. Fixed the Auto-Rig not working when the spine consists only of a neck and a head. 16.2.0 New New Kleaner which does anticipations, follow-through and smart interpolations through expressions. This new tool replaces the Spring as it has the same features and many more. It also has a better performance. The Motion Trail has been completely re-built, and now has a taper option and is also able to take the 3D space and layer scale into account to automatically adjust the width of the stroke. The Extract Controllers is now able to extract only new controllers in case there have been changes made to the rig. [Alt + Click] now \u201cun-extracts\u201d the controllers from the selected precomposition. A new God Mode for the interface, which is very tiny! Improvements The interface has been improved and a bit re-organised for a faster access to most common tools. The performance of the Search and Replace tool has been greatly improved for expressions. The performance of the Structures creation and of the Auto-rig have been improved. The use of Master Properties to extract controllers has been improved for After Effects CC2020 and more recent. The Wonder Unit Storyboarder import now also imports images from the Shot Generator . The contextual help has been updated. Fixes Fixed the Storyboarder import with the latest versions of Wonder Unit Storyboarder . Fixed the head controller of the Auto-rig to make it work correctly when adding a zero. 16.1.3 Improvements You can now use custom controllers with the Auto-rig Fixes Fixed some bugs introduced in 16.1.2 (Slider controllers, effectors, and some constraints). Fixed manual IK Rigging. 16.1.2 Improvements Some expressions have been modernized, and the underlying system for generating expressions in Duik have been improved. This is going to improve performance in future versions. This work comes with a nice way to share an expression library for animators and developpers. Fixes The tool to separate dimensions of properties now removes the keyframes from the original property. The tool to separate dimension now correctly separates the dimensions of the position property too, using the After Effects native method. The connector now works correctly with \u201ccustom\u201d properties like the histogram or the mesh warp effect. Layer selectors (like the ones in the options of the Walk Cycle now work correctly when selected layers are not selected from top to bottom. B\u00e9zier IK (like the ones used in spines) no longer moves the layers on creation. B\u00e9zier IK now works on custom Structures. Fixed some tools not working in non-English Duik: Slider Controllers, Parent Constraint, Effector When extracting controllers or rigging limbs with footroll, the IK Data is now correctly linked and can be correctly detected by the new Connector 16.1.1 Fixes The connector no longer breaks project expressions when renaming comps in specific cases. The header of the controllers panel is no longer hidden in rookie and standard modes. 16.1.0 New (UX/UI) Duik is now available split in several optional pannels. This means each tab of Duik can be now in its own panel and docked separately into the user interface of After Effects. Individual panels can be opened by [Alt] + [Click] on the tab buttons. Included with this individual panels: Duik Cmd, a tiny UI with a simple command line interface for Duik. Duik now uses a welcome screen at startup, which greatly improves launch time. In order to fix any problem with Duik, like its settings file getting corrupted sometimes on Mac, there\u2019s now a way to re-initialize everything. Added some buttons with useful links: At the bottom of the panel: Bug Report and Feature Request In the help window: Forum and Live Chat New (Links & Constraints) A tool to Separate Dimensions of any property, including colors which can be animated both as RGB or HSL. The Auto-Parent tool helps you parent layers very quickly. The additional panel for the Bone now includes a button to select and show or hide all the bones in the composition. The Connector now works with a spatial effector, a texture effector or the new Expose Transform tool too. The Expose Transform tool is very useful with the Connector or to build your own expressions and automate a lot of stuff. The IK effect on controllers now exposes the distance between the end and the root of the limb, which may be very useful with the connector or in your own expressions. New (Automations) The new Effector Map tool is able to connect any property to a texture effector. New (Controllers) A tag controller tool to set any layer so Duik can recognise it as a controller (very useful for the extract controllers tool for example). Hold the [Alt] button when creating controllers to create only one controller centered on the average positions of the selected layers. Hold the [Ctrl] button to automatically parent the selected layers to the newly created controller(s). New (Other rigging tools) A tool to Align Layers in the rigging tools panel. With the Edit mode , you can (un/re)parent all the children of a layer. You can Remove expressions while keeping the post-expression value. It is easy to Copy & Paste Expressions without changing the current value of several properties at once with the copy and paste expressions buttons. Some other advanced rigging tools have been added, useful for those who create their own expressions or scripts (expert mode only): You can get some Property Info about the selected property, like its index, its matchName, the expression link to it, etc. A Scriptify expression tool makes it quick to include an expression as a string in a .jsx script. New (Other) Reimplemented and improved the TVPaint import tool from Duik 15. Duik now also imports JSON exported from TVPaint 11+, in a simpler and stabler way than the script provided by TVPaint (and with the ability to choose which layers to import). Added German translation . The interpolation adjustment tools in the Keyframes has been greatly improved, with sliders for velocity and buttons with useful predefined values. Improvements The Connector can now be used in a single click (creates a controller layer automatically). The Connector User Interface for the additionnal panel has been improved a bit to be clearer and easier to use. When used on opacities, the Connector automatically makes the layer visible. When Structures are created with something selected in the composition (Bezier paths, puppet pins, or layers), Duik will try to create these Structures on the selection and name them after the selected elements. If you hold the [Ctrl] key and there was a selection (path, pins or layers) in the composition when creating Structures , Duik will automatically link (parent or expression) the selection to the Structures . The head controller with the Autorig now controls the head position too. The preferences (and language files) of Duik are now saved by default in a \u201cDuik\u201d subfolder of your \u201cDocuments\u201d folder, instead of directly in the \u201cDocuments\u201d folder. You can still change the location of the preferences in the settings panel of Duik. The Structures colors for predefined limbs have been improved to better show the hierarchy. The User Interface has been tweaked to fix some details and improve the overall User Experience. All buttons for showing or hiding stuff (Structures, bones, controllers\u2026) can now invert the visibility with holding the [Alt] button, instead of showing or hiding them all. The Structures layer names are now translated to the language set in the settings (if the translation file is up-to-date). The Path Constraint effect now has a \u201c Path Offset \u201d option. The Add Bones button now creates a single bone if nothing is selected, which you can then use any way you want. The performance of the Search and Replace tool has been slightly improved for expressions. There\u2019s still some ongoing work to dramatically improve it\u2019s performance. Controllers as null layers are 3D layers when the selected layer is 3D. The Path Constraint can now be created in a single click. Fixes The version of Duik is now checked correctly (even for alpha and beta tests), and there is no warning if the version installed is the same than the available one. The extract controllers tool now takes the precomposition start time into account in the links, thus you can safely move the precomposed character in time. The Search and replace now correctly ignores locked layers. Adding Bones on shapes on a layer which already has some effects now works correctly. The Parent Constraint now works correctly when the composition start time is not 0. Auto-rig freezing when there\u2019s only one layer selected. Fixed some bugs when creating IK on standard layers instead of Structures . The show/hide button for Structures now works correctly. Fixed the scale expression for the 2D Camera . The Wheel and Parent Constraint now correctly generate motion blur (which can be adjusted to fix performance issues). Fixed animations not importing when interpolation values are invalid. Fixed 3D Controllers extraction. The List does not anymore add an offset on the value when added on a property without keyframes. The Move Away does not generate an expression error anymore when the layer is at the same location as its parent. Some checkboxes not working in the UI are fixed. Duik is now launched correctly on first launch if the File and Network Preference of After Effects was unchecked. The Walk Cycle is now applied correctly when controllers are null layers. Controllers are extracted without generating expression errors when using master properties. The Paint Rig now works correctly with the cloner and eraser tool too. Fixed the expressions errors in the 2D Camera on non-English After Effects. Fixed the IK/FK switch not working in some cases. 16.0.12 Fixes Fixed the Parent constraint expressions not working with the new Javascript enginge. Fixed the Check for updates failing at first start, always stating that a new version is available when it\u2019s not. Fixed the Structures creation failing in huge comps. Fixed the expression errors using the new JavaScript engine with the Framing guides . Fixed the rotation in the Camera Rig . 16.0.11 Fixes Fixed the Connector when an angle is used as a controller property and in some cases there is a jump of 360 degrees, and IK rotation values. Fixed some Structures bugs with the new JavaScript expression engine. Fixed Scale Z-Link . Fixed the Randomize tool when used on keyframe times in absolute mode. Fixed the walk cycle with the new JavaScript expression engine. 16.0.10 Improvements [Alt + Click] on the Zero button resets the position, rotation and scale of the layer. The User Interface has been tweaked to make it always better. Fixes When picking properties with Duik tools, if there is a disabled expression, it stays disabled instead of being enabled by the tool. UI: The buttons can now be clicked anywhere and not only on the text or the icon (except on CS6). Fixed the issue when sometimes two Bones were created for the same puppet pin. Fixed the expressions for the walk cycle with the new expression engine. If errors are still generated, you can jut ignore them, they\u2019ll disappear as soon as you use the controller. Slider, 2D-slider and angle controllers are no longer broken when there are layers selected in the composition before creating them. 16.0.9 Fixes The Spring expressions have been fixed and improved for After Effects 16.0 Copy/Paste animation , which was broken in 16.0.8, is fixed The Extract controllers can now extract the controllers from two rigs in the same composition. Bones on puppet pins are named after the correponding pin. Fixed Bones creation on pins with Ae CC2018 and older. The Storyboarder importer now imports empty boards too. 16.0.8 Fixes The Walk Cycle now works with the new expression engine in After Effects 16.0 16.0.7 Fixes The rigging tools panel is displaying again. Adding Bones on scaled layers no longer moves them to another location. 16.0.6 New The Bones can control the new puppet pins in After Effects 16.0: they handle the rotation and scale of the pins too. Improvements Expressions used by Duik have been improved for the new expression engine in After Effects 16.0 Fixes Random tool now correctly sets values on animated properties. Parent Constraint now works when the dimensions of the position are separated. Storyboarder import fixed (again). Extract Controllers now works correctly when dimensions are separated on the controllers. Extract Controllers now longer has an expression error on foot roll effects. The anchor size of the Controllers can now be set to 0% without generating an expression error. Fixed the Time remap tool. The parent used in a Parent contraint can now be scaled to 0% without generating an expression error. Fixed a bunch of minor bugs, stability improved. Overall stability improved (especially regarding composition names and links accross compositions). 16.0.5 New Chinese translation, thanks to eZioPan. Re-implemented the Lock Property tool from Duik 15 (in the constraints panel, Standard and Expert mode only). Improvements The Effector layer is now created as a guide layer. Fixes 2D Camera no longer crashes if there\u2019s no active composition. Extract controllers no longer fails when launched from the additionnal panel of the tool. Extract controllers and other tools are more robust and should throw less errors in unusual cases. IK/FK Switch now works with controllers extracted from a precomposition. Walk Cycle now works with controllers extracted from a precomposition. Some labels could not be translated in the User Interface and stayed in English. This is now fixed and everything should be translated in upcoming versions. Fixed some stability issues, and made some small performance improvements. Fixed the tools not working if the composition is selected from the project panel and the composition in the viewer is not the same. 16.0.4 Fixes Duik now really imports correctly Wonderunit Storyboarder files made with the latest version. 16.0.3 Fixes Duik now imports correctly Wonderunit Storyboarder files made with the latest version. 16.0.2 Improvements Duik now checks for updates and reads the news only once a day. Fixes The Framing guides are now created as guide layers. There is no longer any error when the serveur for news and updates is unavailable. 16.0.1 Fixes Fixed the Connector used with a master property which has one dimension only. 16.0.0 Improvements The Select Keyframes now works like the other tools, in a single click with an additionnal panel for the settings Parent Accross Comps now locks and hides the locators Changed controllers\u2019 label Changed structures\u2019 label Structures are selected after duplication The scale of Structures is now locked The Connector now detects the same pre-existing effects and uses them instead of creating new ones Parent Accross Comps now creates a single locator instead of one locator per child. Completed French translation Completed Documentation (but without screenshots, and still needs more details) Fixes Fixed performance issue with the Copy/paste anim (when reversed keyframes is checked). Fixed Select Keyframes tool with properties with separated dimensions. Fixed translations loading Fixed the Arm Autorig without shoulder Fixed Autorig on previously duplicated Strucutures Fixed the list not getting the initial value of the property Fixed the Autorig not detecting the side of the legs Fixed Add Bones freezing when selecting non spatial properties or groups Fixed Position Constraint which now works correctly even with parenting on the constrained layer. Fixed the automatic position of shoulders with the Autorig Fixed the neck and shoulder rotating away from their original orientation with the Autorig Fixed the Autorig run on duplicated structures Removed debug alert when using the Wiggle on single dimensionnal properties 16.0.0-RC2 Improvements Huge performance improvement at startup, with help from Lars Jandel (again). The Auto-rig is smarter: it can rig a mix between predefined limbs and custom structures UI tweaks Fixes Fixed Bezier IK and Spine Auto-rig strange behavior 16.0.0-RC1 Improvements Extract Controllers now able to extract all controllers, including the ones which are parented to any other layer, thanks to the new Parent Accross Comps tool. You now have the option to use null layers for controllers instead of shape layers ( Standard and Expert modes only) Duik can now be launched without the \u201cFile and network access\u201d preference (but with limited features and without icons). All dialogs at first start have been removed to be included in the main panel of Duik itself. Duik now checks for updates at startup (like previous versions) The help panel now includes \u201c news \u201d and \u201c about \u201d tabs to know more about Duik and Rainbox. The user guide and contextual help have been updated with a lot of new documentation. The Calculator has been removed. Lots of UI tweaks and improvements Fixes Animation Panel : the ease slider now automatically change linear keyframes to bezier with velocity set to 0. Clicking the Autorig & IK button no longer crashes Duik when there are no active composition. Duik should now work properly in Mac OS with network sessions (?). Please confirm if it\u2019s your case ;) Fixed startup in Mac OS. Fixed file extensions with exports in Mac OS Exporting to Audition with transcoding now works in Mac OS 16.0.0-Beta-1 New Duplicate Structures easily with a single button. Export and Import Animations re-implemented from Duik 15. Improvements Wonder Unit Storyboarder now handles PSD boards. Looper now has a parameter to set the number of keyframes to loop. Several FK Over IK improvements (A checkbox to disable Automatic Follow Through, animate the goal in the individual controls\u2026) Legs rigged with the Autorig and a foot roll can now be switched to FK. This is a huge improvement for walk cycle animations: as soon as the foot leaves the ground, you can swith to FK and animate very simply the rotations of the leg. Position Constraint : default weight to 0% to prevent layers from \u201cjumping\u201d away when setting the constraint. Import Animation : option to offset the values from the current ones. Import Animation : option to import all property values, or only the properties with keyframes. Import Animation : filters on property types: import only the position, or rotation, or shapes, or everything\u2026 Import Animation : option to replace existing animation or just add the new keyframes Copy/Paste Animation : option to offset the values from the current ones. Copy/Paste Animation : option to replace existing animation or just add the new keyframes Copy/Paste Animation : option to reverse keyframes Fixes Fixed the keyboard shortcuts for the Bones button in the options panel. Bones : tangents width for the bones created on shapes (CC2018) is now adjusted with the size parameter of the bone. Bones have better names when the name is too long. Fixed locator names in the Parent Accross Comps tool Fixed the character encoding issue in the contextual help on Macintosh Several Walk Cycle fixes 16.0.0-Alpha-10 New Contextual Help : Shift+Click on any tool to get some help. Animation blender is a new tool to animate using markers to trigger animations. Setup a composition with some animations and the Animation Blender , and then you just have to add some markers on the controller to trigger the animations, with an optional nice blending between each animation and the ability to loop them. Framing Guides in the Camera panel: creates handy guides in the composition to help your framing and image composition (safe frames, thirds, fibonnacci, isometric perspective\u2026) Parent accross comps is a simple way to parent a layer to another one in a parent composition, or in a precomposition, using locators and expressions. 2D Camera : new controls for predefined behaviours. Easily simulate a shoulder mount, a camera hold by hand, or on a tripod, with shake controls. Re-implemented the translation framework, and added French translation. It is now possible to add new translations to Duik. More details about this will be available on the wiki soon. Re-implemented Export to Audition from Duik 15. Export to Audition now transfers audio levels keyframes too! Improvements Wiggle : you can now control the complexity of the wiggle (octaves and mutliplier) and manually set a Random Seed to keep the same wiggle accross layers. UX/UI tweaks and improvements, stability improved. Fixes Effector set to infinite line is no longer reversed. Changing colors of controllers with Duik no longer freezes Duik. Locking In and Out ease in the animation panel now automatically adjust values according to the latest modification (on In or Out ease). Fixed the bad issue where sometimes the After Effects dialog windows would freeze Duik (and all the other scripts), and then display the \u201cCan not run a script while a modal dialog is waiting for response\u201d error when trying to launch any script again (based on an idea by _Lars Jandel. 16.0.0-Alpha-9 New Walk Cycle : the first procedural animation is available. The keyframe types button in the Animation panel can now be used to create keyframes on all animated properties. Extract controllers automatically from a precomp to your main composition, and animate outside of the precomposed character. Scale, flip, flop the character as you need. With After Effects > 15.1, extracted controllers can use Master Properties to be able to animate several instances of the same rig, in the same project. The Auto-rig is now smart enough to detect what you need if you\u2019re applying it to something else than predefined Structures . The IK and FK buttons have been removed from the Rookie UI mode, and moved into the Auto-rig options in the Standard and Expert modes. A new automation, the Looper allows to add both a loopIn and a loopOut on several properties at once, and control them with an animatable effect. The loops can be of the standard three types: \u201cCycle\u201d, \u201cOffset, \u201cPing Pong\u201d, and \u201cContinue\u201d. The Effector now has two modes: Circle or Infinite line . You can now import your traditionnal animations from Krita , just export them as CSV! Improvements Huge performance improvement. A lot of work have been made to make Duik run faster (especially the Structure creation and Autorig). Structures , Bones , and Controllers are now created with their quality set to \u201cDraft\u201d to improve performance in After Effects. FK Overlap now has individual controls for layers. FK Overlap option to (not)inherit the rotation of the parent layer. FK Overlap over IK. When an IK is created, the checkbox to deactivate IK activates individual FK controls as well as a Follow-Through & Overlap control. Added a checkbox to show/hide handles for the curvation of Bezier IK . They are now hidden by default. Added an individual control for the toes rotation in the Foot roll Add Bones is smarter: it will search for properties (with a priority for puppet pins) if there are no property selected. Add Bones adds nice effects when used on shapes, to allow the deletion of unneeded control layers afterwards. You can use an Orientation Constraint to create what was called the IK Goal in Duik 15, with much more possibilities. You can now link dimensions when using the Random tool on values. The data displayed in the IK effects is improved. The IK length is now computed in FK too, to be able to use it with the connector more reliably than using the Structure rotation. The Connector now automatically populates the \u201cmin\u201d and \u201cmax\u201d values based on the actual animation of the master property. A lot UI adjustments and improvements Fixes FK Overlap now working correctly with a parent. Bezier IK curve controller now created at a correct size, depending on the settings of the controllers. Walk Cycle now works better when there\u2019s no layer selected. The Auto-Rig for legs with foot roll now works when the structures have been rotated before running the Auto-Rig . The Search and Replace tool has been fixed. 16.0.0-Alpha-8 New Rookie Mode : An easy-to-use interface for beginners. Note: Duik will automatically switch to this mode on first start, go to the settings to set it again to standard or expert mode. Animation: IK/FK Snap and switch. Improvements IK (2 and 3 layers): rotation values are improved to prevent a \u201cjump\u201d in some cases. The rotation value on the upper part of the limb will now have a 360\u00b0 jump in the opposite direction than its orientation when the IK is created. IK (2 and 3 layers): the \u201creverse\u201d option in the effec of the controller have been moved unearthed to be more accessible. Structures : Use Alt+Click to assign a random color on creation. Bones : Use Alt+Click to assign a random color on creation. Bones : Use Ctrl+Click to create bones for vertices only, and not tangents (Quicker in case the shape does not use tangents). UI Tweaks. Lots of invisible tweaks. Some performance improvements (especially with some expressions in the Structures). Fixes List : no more error when applying on a spatial property (but spatial tangents will be lost) FK Overlap now works better even when the root has a parent. 16.0.0-Alpha-7 New FK Overlap tool, very useful for tails and ropes (or even arms)! 16.0.0-Alpha-6 New Re-implemented tools from Duik15: Camera Rig , Scale Z-Link , Import TVPaint Camera The Auto-rig now rigs tails.

Improvements Controllers scale locked on creation Controllers new shapes available Controllers : Slider , 2D Slider and Angle controllers now split in two layers: the actual control and a background. No more need to double click to animate them. Randomize UI updated to new UI style Expert Mode UI improvements Structures rotation and scale are now reset to 0 and 100% before applying IK/autorig Fixes Bezier IK not selecting the controller at the end of the creation. Bezier IK handles now working even when guides are hidden Orientation Constraint now working even if the constrained layer has a parent. 16.0.0-Alpha-5 New WonderUnit Storyboarder file import Implemented 2D Camera (renamed the 2D Multiplane from Duik 15) 2D Camera: Ability to add a layer (just duplicate any existing layer) Implemented the Autorig (legs, arms, spine but not tails or custom structures/layers yet) Improvements User Interface has been polished | The Expert mode might still have some issues which will be fixed later Layers created by Duik are now tagged with a marker. The marker can be renamed by the user, but cannot be removed: some data is stored internally to help Duik identify the layers and compute stuff. Fixes Bezier IK the \u201ccurve\u201d controller is now a position controller. Removed the Attachment Constraint which did not work as expected. Use the other constraints instead. 16.0.0-Alpha-4 Prepared Wonder Unit Storyboarder file import. 16.0.0-Alpha-3 New Animation Kleaner to clean the keyframes. Includes the Smart interpolations and Spatial Interpolations tools from previous Alpha versions. Connector able to connect to \u201cfake\u201d layer sequences using layer opacities (very powerful tool) Improvements UX: (clicking on the tab buttons sets the default panel - closes the current tool - for the tab) Connector UX/UI small improvements UI: Improved animation panel (separated keyframe tools and animation tools) Better naming conventions for controllers, bones, structures\u2026 Fixes Effector now works when re-using an existing controller layer. Randomize for properties and keyframes Connector when connecting a parent with an expression. Connector when connecting shapes and other unusual properties. IK when the root has a parent Bones on shapes with CC2018 16.0.0-Alpha-2 New Keyframe selection tool (in the animation tab) to easily batch select keyframes by type or by layers. Re-implemented tools from Duik 15: Rename , Search and replace , Measure .

Bone . Auto-rig : The process of rigging an armature (or standard objects), and the name of the tool doing this process. cf. Rig . Bake : The process of removing a dynamic, procedural, computed value and replacing it by a fixed value, so it cannot be edited anymore, with the goal of improving the performance. Blocking (animation): A usual first step of the digital animation process, where there is no interpolation between keyframes. This helps the animator focus on the poses and their shapes, and the timing between these keyframes. Bone : In digital, rigged animation, an object used to manipulate a part of a limb (or object) between two joints. The smallest rigid part of a limb. The pivot of the bone represents the actual joint it is attached to; the end of the bone is usually the joint of the next bone in the chain. The bone is the base unit of a Kinematic Chain . Breakdown (animation): In traditional animation, a secondary keyframe added between key poses, to add details to a movement, but which does not represent an important pose, which is in a fast part of the motion. Cel (animation): In traditional, hand-drawn animation, the cel is a single drawing, usually made on transparent material, a layer used to composite a frame of the animation. The name comes from Celluloid and should be written with a single L , it is not a cell . Chain : see Kinematic Chain . Constraint : An automation which automates the movement of a part of a rig. In After Effects, it\u2019s usually the result of using expressions, although a simple parenting can be considered a constraint. Controller : An object used to animate a rigged character or object. The controller is the object receiving the keyframes, while the whole rig (bones and artwork) reacts thanks to constraints . Degrees of Freedom : In physics, the degrees of freedom of a mechanical system is the number of independent parameters that define its configuration or state. It is important in the analysis of systems of bodies in mechanical engineering, structural engineering, aerospace engineering, robotics, and other fields. The position of a single railcar (engine) moving along a track has one degree of freedom because the position of the car is defined by the distance along the track. A train of rigid cars connected by hinges to an engine still has only one degree of freedom because the positions of the cars behind the engine are constrained by the shape of the track. An automobile with highly stiff suspension can be considered to be a rigid body traveling on a plane (a flat, two-dimensional space). This body has three independent degrees of freedom consisting of two components of translation and one angle of rotation. Drag (animation principle): When a character starts to move and parts of it take a few frames to catch up. These parts can be inanimate objects like clothing or the antenna on a car, or parts of the body, such as arms or hair. On the human body, the torso is the core, with arms, legs, head and hair appendices that normally follow the torso\u2019s movement. Body parts with much tissue, such as large stomachs and breasts, or the loose skin on a dog, are more prone to independent movement than bonier body parts. Exposure (animation): The length of time that an image stays on the screen. In digital animation, the exposure depends on the frame rate, and each image is displayed the duration of a frame. But in traditional animation (or tradigital animation), the animator can choose for each image how long it stays on screen (usually using a dope sheet or exposure sheet ). Extrapolation : Method for estimating new data outside of a known data set. Applied to animation, it is a method to generate some motion after (or before) existing keyframes, based on the existing animation between the keyframes. FK ( Forward Kinematics ): The mathematical process of calculating the position of the end of a Kinematic Chain , such as a character\u2019s armature, from the values of the joint parameters (usually rotation angles). For example if the object to be animated is an arm with the shoulder remaining at a fixed location, the location of the tip of the thumb would be calculated from the angles of the shoulder, elbow, wrist, thumb and knuckle joints. The reverse process, that computes the joint parameters that achieve a specified position of the end-effector, is known as Inverse Kinematics . Follow through (animation principle): Loosely tied parts of a body should continue moving after the character has stopped and the parts should keep moving beyond the point where the character stopped only to be subsequently \u201cpulled back\u201d towards the center of mass or exhibiting various degrees of oscillation damping. Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston explained in their book on Disney animation The Illusion of life : A character might have a coat or long ears, and these parts would keep moving once the figure had stopped moving. The ears, or coat, would \u201cfollow through\u201d even after the main action had stopped. The completion of an action - how the action \u201cfollows through\u201d - is often more important than the action itself. The \u201cmoving hold\u201d. A character might come to a complete halt, but the fleshy parts might follow through the main action in order to convey weight and believability. IK ( Inverse Kinematics ): The mathematical process of calculating the variable joint parameters (usually rotation angles) needed to place the end of a Kinematic Chain , such as a character\u2019s armature, in a given position and orientation relative to the start of the chain. Given joint parameters, the position and orientation of the chain\u2019s end, e.g. the hand of the character, can typically be calculated directly using multiple applications of trigonometric formulas, a process known as Forward Kinematics . However, the reverse operation is, in general, much more challenging. This is also true when animating: using Inverse Kinematics means animating the position of the end of the chain (the hand), and positions are notoriously more difficult to animate than rotations, as the animator has to take care of two (or three) dimensions and the trajectory, whereas rotations are usually more constrained and have less degrees of freedom, thus easier to animate. Inheritance (parenting): To form a Kinematic Chain, objects are parented together: the start of the chain is the ancestor, and the end is the (grand\u2026) child. Child objects inherits the transformation of their parent (and can have only one parent): all rotations, translations or scales of the parent is inherited by the child which moves with its parent. Interpolation : Method for estimating new data between known data in a set. Applied to animation, it is a method to generate the motion between the keyframes, to control the movement and velocity between two (or more) keyframes. Kinematic Chain : In mechanical engineering, a kinematic chain is an assembly of rigid bodies connected by joints to provide constrained motion that is the mathematical model for a mechanical system. Applied to armatures in animation, a Kinematic Chain, or Bone Chain is a set of bones parented together, from an end to a root. For example, an arm is a Kinematic Chain where the hand is parented to the forearm, which is parented to the arm, which is parented to the shoulder. Kinematics : Subfield of physics, developed in classical mechanics, that describes the motion of points, bodies (objects), and systems of bodies (groups of objects) without considering the forces that cause them to move. Kinematics, as a field of study, is often referred to as the \u201cgeometry of motion\u201d and is occasionally seen as a branch of mathematics. Locator : An object to expose the location (i.e. the absolute coordinates) of another object. Master : An object or a property controlling another property, leaving it without any degree of freedom, through a connection , such as one made with Duik\u2019s connector. Don\u2019t be offended by the use of this vocabulary, we\u2019re talking about abstract properties and layers, there\u2019s no harm. Meta-rig : A predefined Armature which already includes all needed information for it to be completely rigged once applied on a given character. Numerical Property : A property defined by a number. In After Effects, most properties are numerical properties, if we consider multi-dimensional properties to be numerical too. In this sense, colors are numerical properties (with four dimensions, Red, Green, Blue and Alpha), whereas the source text property of a text layer is not a numerical property, nor the path property of a mask or a shape. Overlap / Overlapping animation : Overlapping animation is one of the most important animation principles. It is the tendency for parts of the body to move at different rates, for example when the hand rotates after the forearm which itself rotates after the arm. Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston explained in their book on Disney animation The Illusion of life : Bodies in motion do not move all at once, rather different parts of a body may move at different speeds. Loose flesh, such as a dog\u2019s floppy jowls, might move at a slower speed than the more solid parts of the character. These parts might drag behind the main action. Parent : see Inheritance . Procedural Animation : Animation generated with parameters, such as the weight, the energy, some character traits, instead of keyframes. Such an animation is generated from the parameters without the need to add any keyframe to the properties. In Duik, the Walk Cycle , the Wiggle , the Swink , etc. are all procedural animations. Rig : The process of preparing a character (or any object) to be animated more easily than directly manipulating the artwork. More specifically the process of adding constraints and controllers to the armature controlling the artwork. Simulation : The computation of a movement using mathematical functions based on laws of physics, and some parameters or in continuity (extrapolation and interpolation) of an existing animation. This usually costs a lot in terms of performance, and may lead to poor animation; for example, a simulated bouncing ball may touch the ground between actual frames of the video, and in this case the contact would not be seen by the audience and the ball would seem to float instead of bouncing. Slave : An object or property connected to a Master property, which movement is completely constrained (automated) by this connection. Squash and Stretch (animation principle): This principle is based on observation that only stiff objects remain inert during motion,\u200a while objects that are not stiff, although retaining overall volume, tend to change shape in an extent that depends on inertia and elasticity of the different parts of the moving object. For example, a ball would change shape, compressing ( squash ) as it hits the ground, then extending ( stretch ) as it bounces up again. Inbe Tweening : The process in animation that involves creating intermediate frames, called inbetweens, between two keyframes. The intended result is to create the illusion of movement by smoothly transitioning one image into another. Weight (parameter): A mathematical function to give some elements more influence on the result than other elements in the same set. The result of this application of a weight function is a weighted sum or weighted average. Usually given in percent in animation parameters to \u201cweigh\u201d some values. Some of these definitions are sourced from Wikipedia .","title":"Glossary"},{"location":"misc/glossary.html#glossary","text":"Armature : A set of bones connected (i.e. parented) together, a set of bone or kinematic chains. cf. Bone . Auto-rig : The process of rigging an armature (or standard objects), and the name of the tool doing this process. cf. Rig . Bake : The process of removing a dynamic, procedural, computed value and replacing it by a fixed value, so it cannot be edited anymore, with the goal of improving the performance. Blocking (animation): A usual first step of the digital animation process, where there is no interpolation between keyframes. This helps the animator focus on the poses and their shapes, and the timing between these keyframes. Bone : In digital, rigged animation, an object used to manipulate a part of a limb (or object) between two joints. The smallest rigid part of a limb. The pivot of the bone represents the actual joint it is attached to; the end of the bone is usually the joint of the next bone in the chain. The bone is the base unit of a Kinematic Chain . Breakdown (animation): In traditional animation, a secondary keyframe added between key poses, to add details to a movement, but which does not represent an important pose, which is in a fast part of the motion. Cel (animation): In traditional, hand-drawn animation, the cel is a single drawing, usually made on transparent material, a layer used to composite a frame of the animation. The name comes from Celluloid and should be written with a single L , it is not a cell . Chain : see Kinematic Chain . Constraint : An automation which automates the movement of a part of a rig. In After Effects, it\u2019s usually the result of using expressions, although a simple parenting can be considered a constraint. Controller : An object used to animate a rigged character or object. The controller is the object receiving the keyframes, while the whole rig (bones and artwork) reacts thanks to constraints . Degrees of Freedom : In physics, the degrees of freedom of a mechanical system is the number of independent parameters that define its configuration or state. It is important in the analysis of systems of bodies in mechanical engineering, structural engineering, aerospace engineering, robotics, and other fields. The position of a single railcar (engine) moving along a track has one degree of freedom because the position of the car is defined by the distance along the track. A train of rigid cars connected by hinges to an engine still has only one degree of freedom because the positions of the cars behind the engine are constrained by the shape of the track. An automobile with highly stiff suspension can be considered to be a rigid body traveling on a plane (a flat, two-dimensional space). This body has three independent degrees of freedom consisting of two components of translation and one angle of rotation. Drag (animation principle): When a character starts to move and parts of it take a few frames to catch up. These parts can be inanimate objects like clothing or the antenna on a car, or parts of the body, such as arms or hair. On the human body, the torso is the core, with arms, legs, head and hair appendices that normally follow the torso\u2019s movement. Body parts with much tissue, such as large stomachs and breasts, or the loose skin on a dog, are more prone to independent movement than bonier body parts. Exposure (animation): The length of time that an image stays on the screen. In digital animation, the exposure depends on the frame rate, and each image is displayed the duration of a frame. But in traditional animation (or tradigital animation), the animator can choose for each image how long it stays on screen (usually using a dope sheet or exposure sheet ). Extrapolation : Method for estimating new data outside of a known data set. Applied to animation, it is a method to generate some motion after (or before) existing keyframes, based on the existing animation between the keyframes. FK ( Forward Kinematics ): The mathematical process of calculating the position of the end of a Kinematic Chain , such as a character\u2019s armature, from the values of the joint parameters (usually rotation angles). For example if the object to be animated is an arm with the shoulder remaining at a fixed location, the location of the tip of the thumb would be calculated from the angles of the shoulder, elbow, wrist, thumb and knuckle joints. The reverse process, that computes the joint parameters that achieve a specified position of the end-effector, is known as Inverse Kinematics . Follow through (animation principle): Loosely tied parts of a body should continue moving after the character has stopped and the parts should keep moving beyond the point where the character stopped only to be subsequently \u201cpulled back\u201d towards the center of mass or exhibiting various degrees of oscillation damping. Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston explained in their book on Disney animation The Illusion of life : A character might have a coat or long ears, and these parts would keep moving once the figure had stopped moving. The ears, or coat, would \u201cfollow through\u201d even after the main action had stopped. The completion of an action - how the action \u201cfollows through\u201d - is often more important than the action itself. The \u201cmoving hold\u201d. A character might come to a complete halt, but the fleshy parts might follow through the main action in order to convey weight and believability. IK ( Inverse Kinematics ): The mathematical process of calculating the variable joint parameters (usually rotation angles) needed to place the end of a Kinematic Chain , such as a character\u2019s armature, in a given position and orientation relative to the start of the chain. Given joint parameters, the position and orientation of the chain\u2019s end, e.g. the hand of the character, can typically be calculated directly using multiple applications of trigonometric formulas, a process known as Forward Kinematics . However, the reverse operation is, in general, much more challenging. This is also true when animating: using Inverse Kinematics means animating the position of the end of the chain (the hand), and positions are notoriously more difficult to animate than rotations, as the animator has to take care of two (or three) dimensions and the trajectory, whereas rotations are usually more constrained and have less degrees of freedom, thus easier to animate.

Preamble The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works. The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program\u2013to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too. When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things. To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others. For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights. Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it. For the developers\u2019 and authors\u2019 protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users\u2019 and authors\u2019 sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions. Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users\u2019 freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users. Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free. The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. TERMS AND CONDITIONS 0. Definitions. \u201cThis License\u201d refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License. \u201cCopyright\u201d also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks. \u201cThe Program\u201d refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as \u201cyou\u201d. \u201cLicensees\u201d and \u201crecipients\u201d may be individuals or organizations. To \u201cmodify\u201d a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a \u201cmodified version\u201d of the earlier work or a work \u201cbased on\u201d the earlier work. A \u201ccovered work\u201d means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program. To \u201cpropagate\u201d a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well. To \u201cconvey\u201d a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying. An interactive user interface displays \u201cAppropriate Legal Notices\u201d to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion. 1. Source Code. The \u201csource code\u201d for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. \u201cObject code\u201d means any non-source form of a work. A \u201cStandard Interface\u201d means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language. The \u201cSystem Libraries\u201d of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A \u201cMajor Component\u201d, in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it. The \u201cCorresponding Source\u201d for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work\u2019s System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work. The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source. The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work. 2. Basic Permissions. All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law. You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you. Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary. 3. Protecting Users\u2019 Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law. No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures. When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work\u2019s users, your or third parties\u2019 legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures. 4. Conveying Verbatim Copies. You may convey verbatim copies of the Program\u2019s source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program. You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee. 5. Conveying Modified Source Versions. You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date. b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to \u201ckeep intact all notices\u201d. c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it. d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so. A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an \u201caggregate\u201d if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation\u2019s users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate. 6. Conveying Non-Source Forms. You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways: a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange. b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge. c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b. d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements. e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d. A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work. A \u201cUser Product\u201d is either (1) a \u201cconsumer product\u201d, which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, \u201cnormally used\u201d refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product. \u201cInstallation Information\u201d for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made. If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM). The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network. Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying. 7. Additional Terms. \u201cAdditional permissions\u201d are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions. When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission. Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms: a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors. All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \u201cfurther restrictions\u201d within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying. If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms. Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way. 8. Termination. You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11). However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation. Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice. Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10. 9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies. You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so. 10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients. Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License. An \u201centity transaction\u201d is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party\u2019s predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts. You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it. 11. Patents. A \u201ccontributor\u201d is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor\u2019s \u201ccontributor version\u201d. A contributor\u2019s \u201cessential patent claims\u201d are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, \u201ccontrol\u201d includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License. Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor\u2019s essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version. In the following three paragraphs, a \u201cpatent license\u201d is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To \u201cgrant\u201d such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party. If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. \u201cKnowingly relying\u201d means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient\u2019s use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid. If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it. A patent license is \u201cdiscriminatory\u201d if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007. Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law. 12. No Surrender of Others\u2019 Freedom. If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program. 13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License. Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such. 14. Revised Versions of this License. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License \u201cor any later version\u201d applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy\u2019s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program. Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version. 15. Disclaimer of Warranty. THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \u201cAS IS\u201d WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 16. Limitation of Liability. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16. If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee. END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms. To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the \u201ccopyright\u201d line and a pointer to where the full notice is found. <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.> Copyright (C) <year> <name of author> This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version. This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details. You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program. If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>. Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail. If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode: <program> Copyright (C) <year> <name of author> This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details. The hypothetical commands `show w\u2019 and `show c\u2019 should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, your program\u2019s commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \u201cabout box\u201d. You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a \u201ccopyright disclaimer\u201d for the program, if necessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see https://www.gnu.org/licenses/ . The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License. But first, please read https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html .","title":"GNU GPLv3"},{"location":"misc/gnu-gpl.html#gnu-general-public-license","text":"Version 3, 29 June 2007 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. https://fsf.org/ Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.","title":"GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE"},{"location":"misc/gnu-gpl.html#preamble","text":"The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works. The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program\u2013to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too. When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things. To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others. For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights. Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it. For the developers\u2019 and authors\u2019 protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users\u2019 and authors\u2019 sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions. Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users\u2019 freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users. Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free. The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.","title":"Preamble"},{"location":"misc/gnu-gpl.html#terms-and-conditions","text":"","title":"TERMS AND CONDITIONS"},{"location":"misc/gnu-gpl.html#0-definitions","text":"\u201cThis License\u201d refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License. \u201cCopyright\u201d also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks. \u201cThe Program\u201d refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License.

A \u201ccovered work\u201d means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program. To \u201cpropagate\u201d a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well. To \u201cconvey\u201d a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying. An interactive user interface displays \u201cAppropriate Legal Notices\u201d to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.

Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice. Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.","title":"8.

Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.","title":"9.

You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License. An \u201centity transaction\u201d is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party\u2019s predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts. You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.","title":"10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients."},{"location":"misc/gnu-gpl.html#11-patents","text":"A \u201ccontributor\u201d is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor\u2019s \u201ccontributor version\u201d. A contributor\u2019s \u201cessential patent claims\u201d are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, \u201ccontrol\u201d includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License. Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor\u2019s essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version. In the following three paragraphs, a \u201cpatent license\u201d is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To \u201cgrant\u201d such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party. If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. \u201cKnowingly relying\u201d means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient\u2019s use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid. If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it. A patent license is \u201cdiscriminatory\u201d if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.","title":"12.
