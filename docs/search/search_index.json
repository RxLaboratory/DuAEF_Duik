Code Documentation As the coding guidelines state so, we try to document the code at the same time it is written. But there may be some older code which is not documented, or mistakes. If you find any piece of code which is not documented, or mistakes in the framework reference , you can help us improve the documentation. We use JSDoc to write all the code documentation . The html docs are generated from the JSDoc found in DuAEF source code and all its inclusions. All Namespaces, Classes, and Functions must be clearly documented as soon as they are added. We do not have a documentation writing step, and ask all contributors to document what they add to the framework. In very rare cases, we might choose to not document some functions, if we think it\u2019s better they remain hidden from the documentation, mostly because we think they\u2019re too low-level. In this case, a simple comment beginning with // must be added just before the declaration of the function to explain briefly what it does, and that it is voluntarily not fully documented.","title":"Documentation"},{"location":"Documentation/#contribute-to-the-documentation","text":"Note Anyone can contribute and edit the documentation.
