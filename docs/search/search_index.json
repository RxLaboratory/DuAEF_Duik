Some of our code still needs to be updated to follow these convention, but we do our best to respect them when adding new code. Language We develop DuAEF and Duik with the Adobe ExtendScript language, which is based on the ECMAScript standard, and very close to JavaScript (and in a lesser way to ActionScript ). Documentation We use JSDoc to write all the code documentation. The html docs are generated from the JSDoc found in DuAEF and all its inclusions. All Namespaces, Classes, and Functions must be clearly documented as soon as they are added. We do not have a documentation writing step, and ask all contributors to document what they add to the framework. In very rare cases, we might choose to not document some functions, if we think it\u2019s better they remain hidden from the documentation, mostly because we think they\u2019re too low-level. In this case, a simple comment beginning with // must be added just before the declaration of the function to explain briefly what it does, and that it is voluntarily not fully documented. Naming Conventions Class names and Namespace names : Starting with an uppercase Seperate words with an uppercase Example: function PropertyInfo() , DuAEF.DuAE.App = {} Function names , Variable names and Function argument names : Starting with a lowercase Sepreate words with an uppercase Example: var layerProperties; , function doSomething(fisrtArg, secondArg) This applies also for object members: this.isReadOnly Formatting Indentation : Indentation is made with Tab characters and not spaces characters. Curly braces on their own line: function Something() { ... } And not: function Something() { ... } But also: Separate functions with one blank line Terminate files with one blank line Avoid trailing spaces as the end of each file Good practices The implementation of ExtendScript by Adobe is based on an (very) old ECMAScript version. There are some good practises listed here to help avoid common bugs and performance issues. Declaring optionnal arguments and their default values for the functions: The first lines of the functions must take care of optionnal arguments. Here is the best way to handle them: function doSomething(boolArgument, intArgument) { //Set default to true if (typeof boolArgument === 'undefined') boolArgument = true; //Set default to 10 if (typeof intArgument === 'undefined') intArgument = 12; } Loops count must be assigned to a variable before the loop, in order to improve performance. There are two ways to do this: var num = theArray.length; for (var i = 0; i < num; i++) { ... } Or the variable can be assigned directly inside the for statement: for (var i = 0, num = theArray.length; i < num; i++) { ... }","title":"Code guidelines"},{"location":"Code-Guidelines/#code-guidelines","text":"We try to follow as closely as possible following conventions, this make our code easily maintainable and readable.

Setup You can skip this part if you are familiar with git and developing adobe scripts. First of all, be sure to fork this repository. Then, clone it somewhere else than in the Adoble application folder. It will be easier because of the rights required to work in those folders. # In C:/Users/.../Code for example git clone git@github.com:[username]/DuAEF_Duik.git We suggest you to directly create new remotes to not get confused. Remotes allow you to send your changes on a specific link. The default remote is named origin and is pointing to the link you used to clone. Since you are working on a fork, you will need another remote for pointing on the original repository that you will use when you want to get the most recent code. git remote add duik git@github.com:Rainbox-dev/DuAEF_Duik.git # link for later purpose Now, you need to create links to the tools you want to use in the After Effects Scripts folder. You will use mklink for the Windows\u2019 command line or ln -s for Mac and git bash. For DuAEF : mklink \"C:\\Program Files\\Adobe\\Adobe After Effects CC\\Support Files\\Scripts\\ScriptUI Panels\" \"devFolder\\DuAEF\\src\\DuAEF.jsxinc\" # /J is for linking a folder mklink /J \"C:\\Program Files\\Adobe\\Adobe After Effects CC\\Support Files\\Scripts\\ScriptUI Panels\\libs\" \"devFolder\\DuAEF\\src\\libs\" mklink /J \"C:\\Program Files\\Adobe\\Adobe After Effects CC\\Support Files\\Scripts\\ScriptUI Panels\\bin\" \"devFolder\\DuAEF\\src\\bin\" If you want to link Duik, you need to link every file of Duik. You will now be able to run your developement version inside After Effects. Alternatively , you could use linkshellextension on Windows if you are not familiar with the command line. Pick a ticket Generally, all tickets labeled Good First Issue are a good place to start. But feel free to implement whatever you want, and if you don\u2019t know, ask us. Coding Be sure to read the Code guidelines . Once you have chosen what to do, you can start to work ! You should work on a new branch every-time you implement something else. Here is an example: git checkout master # Go back on master if you are not git pull duik master # Retrieve the last version of the code git checkout -b what-my-code-does # Create a new branch # Code # Test # Code # Test again git add [files_you_modified] git commit -m \"What you do, with the id of the issue if possible (#1815)\" Submit your code Once you have committed your code, you can upload your branch on your fork. git push origin what-my-code-does # Send your branch on your fork Then, you can submit a pull request with master/your-branch. We will then review your code and merge it or help you to improve it !

You can find the existing documentation in this folder . If you don\u2019t know how to contribute on github, you can simply download the files you want to edit, or create new ones, and submit them by creating a new issue and attaching all your files, assembled in a zip archive.

Example, documenting the Arm Structure must be done in the file /Sructures/arm The documentation has to be written in English first, which is the language used to develop Duik; then everything can be translated to any language.

We do not have a documentation writing step, and ask all contributors to document what they add to the framework. In very rare cases, we might choose to not document some functions, if we think it\u2019s better they remain hidden from the documentation, mostly because we think they\u2019re too low-level.

To work on the translations, you will need to download the DuTranslator Application (available only on Windows for now, but Mac and Linux versions will be available soon). Click here to download it and unzip all the files on your computer. Double click on DuTranslator.exe to launch it. Duik It is very easy to contribute to the translations of Duik. Existing translations The default language of Duik is English. Available translations are: Chinese ( file ), Espa\u00f1ol ( file ), Fran\u00e7ais ( file ). The translation which would be great to do in priority are (Brazilian) Portuguese , German , Japanese . This list is based on the use of Duik in the world, but if you\u2019d like Duik in any other language, you\u2019re free to translate it to whatever you want. Esparanto would be great too! Translating First, you will need to download DuTranslator (read just above). Then, all you have to do is to open a translation file and start translating all the texts. You can either work on/from an existing translation or create a new one. If you want to modify an existing translation, you can find the translation file in your Documents folder, if Duik has been launched at least once. Just open it with DuTranslator and start working on the translation. If you are creating a new translation for Duik, you can either begin with an existing one, or use this empty file . Don\u2019t forget to change the language id and the language name in the top of DuTranslator after you have opened the file, and save it to a new name. Note The language id is a simple code consisting of two or three letters. Search in this table to find the language id you need, in the 639-1 column. Important The translation file must be named Duik Bassel_id.json where id is the language id you have set in DuTranslator. Testing the translations To see what your translation looks like in Duik, you just have to: Copy the translation file to your Documents folder, where the existing translations should already be. Restart Duik. The new translation should be listed in the settings panel so you can select and use it. If you have moved the settings file of Duik in the settings panel, the translations are moved with it. You\u2019ll find them in the same folder than the settings file. Submitting If you want to share your translation with the rest of the world (thanks!), just send your new or updated translation file to contact_at_rainboxprod_dot_coop .
