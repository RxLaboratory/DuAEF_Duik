# List

The *List* is a simple tool to combine different animations and expressions in the same property.

To create a list, select the property and click on the "List" button.

If an expression was already assigned to the property, it is automatically copied into the first slot of the list, along with the existing keyframes.

The list is added in the layer effects. You can combine up to five animations and expressions.

!!! note
    The result of the mix is calculated in the following way:  
    `value1 * weight1 + value2 * weight2 + value3 * weight3 + value4 * weight4 + value5 * weight5`
