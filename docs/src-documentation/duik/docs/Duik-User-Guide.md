There's always stuff to explain better, or tools which are not yet documented, [any help is appreciated](https://github.com/Rainbox-dev/DuAEF_Duik/wiki/Documentation)!

## Introduction

Duik is a comprehensive animation and rigging tollset for Adobe After Effects.

**It provides the main rigging tools**, found in any 3D software, like IK, controllers, and bones, which you can use in any 3D software, but adapts them to 2D animation in After Effects. With Duik you can rig complex characters and use advanced animation techniques usually used in 3D softwares.
If you do not know what “rigging” means, it may be because it is a bit too soon for you to use those tools. Please refer to the section entitled “Should I use Duik?”.

**Duik has plenty of animation tools too** - managing keyframes and interpolations, traditional animation, animation exposure… - and automations too, like wiggle, spring, swing, wheel, etc. which allow you to animate more quickly and easily.

Duik also has some other useful tools, such as camera controls, that are not solely tied to animation but can be really useful for both animators and riggers.

Duik’s comprehensiveness and ease of use have made it a script used in numerous movies across the world.

## Should I use Duik?

**Rigging - no matter what software you use - is a complicated subject** that requires advanced knowledge of both character animation, the software you are using to do the rigging, and, ideally a good undersanding of anatomy.

Before using Duik to create character rigs, you should master:  

- **General basics of animation**, including character animation (body mechanics, acting, walk cycles, etc.), and basic anatomy.  
- **After Effects animation tools**: keyframe types, interpolations, graph editor…  
- **After Effects rigging tools**: parenting, the basics about expressions, the puppet tool if you plan to use it…

**Do NOT try to learn both After Effects and Duik together. For example, it is NOT a good idea to try to rig a character with a combination of Duik and the puppet tool if you do not perfectly understand how the puppet tool itself works.**

!!! hint
    A complete book about all these subjects is being written by Duduf and will be available... One day or another.
