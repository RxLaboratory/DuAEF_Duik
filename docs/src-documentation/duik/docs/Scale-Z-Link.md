When setting up a 3D set, it can be useful to be able to move a layer away from the camera without changing its apparent size, compensating the distance with the scale value.

Thatâ€™s what the Scale Z-Link does.

This tool works as a toggle, enabling and disabling the effect on the selected layers.
