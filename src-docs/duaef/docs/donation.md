# Donation

Duik is free, and the only way it can stay free for everyone is thanks to your financial contribution, which is the *only* funds we get for its development, distribution and support.

You can either:

- Make [a one-time donation to Rainbox](https://rainboxprod.coop/en/tools/#don)  
- Support [Duduf on Patreon](https://patreon.com/duduf)

The development and maintainment of Duik is a continuous effort, and we couldn't do it without your continuous support, both financial and moral.

Many thanks to all our supporters!
