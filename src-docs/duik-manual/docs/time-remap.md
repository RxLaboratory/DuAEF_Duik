*Time Remap* is a quick way to activate time remapping on the selected layers while automatically adding some useful expressions, like looping.

It automatically adjusts the keyframes in the time remap property to make it work better with loops. The last keyframe is the literal last frame of the layer, not the one just after it as usual in After Effects.
