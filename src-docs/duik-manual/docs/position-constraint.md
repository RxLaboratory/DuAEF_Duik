    Available in _Standard_ and _Expert_ modes only.
    
The Position Constraint links the position of a layer to the positions of other layers.

Select a layer and click on the "Position Constraint" button.
An effect is added on the layer to let you select the constraint and set its weight to adjust the influence.

To constrain a layer to several other layers, you can duplicate the effect, and adjust the weight of each constraint.
