> _After Effects might not be the only software you use in your animation pipeline. Duik comes with some **tools to help you import and export assets** to and from other softwares, like_ **Krita**, **TVPaint**, _or_ **Audition**... _Duik is also able to export animations (and the rigs, soon) to an open_ JSON _format so that with just a bit of development you can use them in any other software or game engine._
