Duik Bassel includes some powerful tools you may need from time to time during the animation process.

- ![Ik Fk switch Icon](img/duik-icons/ikfk-icon-r.png) **[IK/FK Switch](ik-fk-switch.md)** is an easy way to switch between IK and FK during the animation, if the layers have been rigged by Duik Bassel.
- ![Blender Icon](img/duik-icons/animblender-icon-r.png) **[Animation Blender](animation-blender.md)** is a nice shortcut to list and animate with markers on compositions previously rigged by the *[Animation Blender](animation-blender-setup.md)*.
- ![motion trail Icon](img/duik-icons/motiontrail-icon-r.png) **[Motion Trail](motion-trail.md)** displays the trajectory of any layer using a shape layer, and can make trails behind them. _(CC2018 and above only)_
- ![x sheet Icon](img/duik-icons/xsheet-icon-r.png) **[X-Sheet](x-sheet.md)** is a simple way to adjust the animation exposure of the properties, the layers or the whole composition.
- ![time remap Icon](img/duik-icons/timeremap-icon-r.png) **[Time Remap](time-remap.md)** is a quick way to activate time remapping on the layers while adding some useful expressions, like looping.
- ![extract controller Icon](img/duik-icons/extractcontrollers-icon-r.png) **[Extract Controllers](../Controller-Tools/#extract-controllers)** will extract the controllers from the selected precomposition and copy them in the current composition, to be able to animate outside of the character precomposition.
- ![cel anim Icon](img/duik-icons/cel-icon-r.png) **[Cel Animation](cel-animation.md)** is a tool to animate frame by frame using the paint effect in After Effects.
