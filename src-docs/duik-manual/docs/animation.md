## ![Animation Icon](img\duik-icons\animation-icon-r.png) Animation

> _Duik is not only a tool for rigging, but includes **everything you need to speed up your animation process**. There are tools to **manage interpolations**, to quickly **select keyframes**, to automatically **smooth all the animations**, to create **traditionnal animation** and to work with traditionnal animation, to **reveal trajectories**â€¦_

The animation panel is divided in two parts:

- **[Keyframes](keyframe-tools.md)**: these are the tools you may need all the time when you are actually animating.
- **[Tools](animation-tools.md)**: these are some tools you may need from time to time during the animation process.
