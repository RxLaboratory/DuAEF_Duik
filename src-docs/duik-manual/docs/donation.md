# Donation

Duik Bassel is a free software released under the “GNU General Public License”

This means that Duik is free, as in free beer as well as in freedom.

But unlike most of the free stuff you can find on the internet, there’s **no advertising at all**, and **you are not the product** here.  
**We just work in a non-mercantile way**, and consider sharing as a great value. It is important for us that Duik and our other tools are available for everyone, rich or poor, amateur or professionnal. Because our greatest wish is to see great films, and we believe sharing and helping each other is the easiest way to make it come true.

The difficult part is that developping, maintaining, distributing Duik is a lot of work and investement. The only funds we get for all of this are your kind contributions.

**We’re thousands to use Duik, if everyone donated a few dollars, the future of Duik could be assured for a few years!**

- You can either **support Duduf, the developper of Duik**, on Patreon (https://patreon.com/duduf) with a small but recurrent contribution which best reflects that this is a continuous work (and he’s sharing more than just Duik),

- Or you can also support Rainbox with a donation right now (https://rainboxprod.coop).

- Note that another nice way to thank us for this free work is to send us the films you’ve made using Duik!

The development and maintainment of Duik is a continuous effort, and we couldn't do it without your continuous support, both financial and moral.

Many thanks to all our supporters!
