# ![effector Icon](img\duik-icons\automation\effector-map-icon-r.png) Effector Map

The "Effector Map" is a way to control properties depending on a texture (map).

## Setup

Like the [Connector](connector.md), the effector needs keyframes on the controlled property to work.

1. Animate the slave properties
2. Select the texture layer and click on "Pick texture layer"
3. Select the slave properties and click on the "Effector Map" button.
4. You can adjust the behaviour of the Effector Map in the effects of the texture layer.

## Effect

In the effect of the Texture layer, you can select the channel to use (red, green, blue, hue, saturation, value, alpha) and you can change the limits.
