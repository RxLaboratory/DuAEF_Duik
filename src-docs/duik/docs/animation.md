## ![Animation Icon](img\duik-icons\animation-icon-r.png) Animation

Duik Bassel provides a lot of tools very useful for character (and other) animation.

The animation panel is divided in two parts:

- **[Keyframes](keyframe-tools.md)**: these are the tools you may need all the time when you are actually animating.
- **[Tools](animation-tools.md)**: these are some tools you may need from time to time during the animation process.
