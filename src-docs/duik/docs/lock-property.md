# Lock property

!!! hint
    Available in _Standard_ and _Expert_ modes only.

Use the _Lock property_ button to add a very simple expression to the selected properties and freeze their values. Once the expression is set, the user will not be able to edit or keyframe the property anymore.

Just remove the expression to unlock the property.

!!! note
    The expression which is created only consists in the current value of the property, effectively locking it to this value.
