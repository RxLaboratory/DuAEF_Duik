    We're currently in the making of the Official Duik Bassel video course, a very complete course with a lot of tutorials like [the one we made for the previous version](https://en.tuto.com/after-effects/after-effects-and-duik-setup-your-first-characters-after-effects,73651.html?cc=vyKT3i), Duik 15.
