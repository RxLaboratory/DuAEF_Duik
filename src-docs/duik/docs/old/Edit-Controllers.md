In the edition panel, you can adjust the appearance of the Controllers (Normal and Expert mode).

All changes made in this panel will affect all selected Controllers and the creation of all other Controllers.

- You can change the size of the Controllers, either automatically, relatively to the size of the composition (small, medium and large options), or with an absolute value (custom option).

- You can change the color of the Controllers: if you click on the colored label, a color picker will be shown, but you can also set your own hexadecimal color code in the text field. A random button will set a random color.

- You can pick the selected Controllers appearance with the "Get" button, and set the parameters to the selection with the "Set" button.

- The "Bake Appearance" button will remove all expressions used by the Controllers to set its appearance. This will improve the performance of the rig, but you will not be able to change the appearance afterwards.

- You can choose to use shape layers (with icons and visual feedback) or simpler null objects to create controllers by default when using the rigging tools.
