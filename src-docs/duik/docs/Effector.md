# Effector

The "Effector" is a way to control properties depending on a spatial effector.

## Setup

Like the [Connector](../Connector), the effector needs keyframes on the controlled property to work.

1. Animate the slave property
2. Select the property and click on the "Effector" button.
3. You can adjust the behaviour of the Effector in its effects.

You can also connect a new property to an existing Effector: before clicking on the button, select the property AND the Effector you want to connect.

## Effect

In the effect of the Effector, you can change the limits, and choose between two modes: circle and inifinite line.
Note that in the infinite line mode, the outter limit is ignored.
