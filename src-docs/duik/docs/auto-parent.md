# Auto-Parent

The *Auto-Parent* tool helps you parent layers very quickly. It is very useful if you have to scroll a lot in the layer stack to parent a layer, or if you have to parent a lot of layers to the same one.

All the children will automatically be parented to the layer you have selected last.

1. Select all the children
2. Add the parent to the selection
3. Click on *Auto-Parent*
