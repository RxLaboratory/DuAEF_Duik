Good animation needs a good camera. The camera has to be considered as one of the characters of the animation, and its animation has to be as detailed as the animation of the characters the spectator see in the image.
This is the reason why Duik has useful camera tools too.

== Tools ==

• Camera rig: Rigs a 3D camera with useful controllers.
• Scale Z-Link: a tool to move layers on the Z axis without changing their apparent size.
• 2D Camera: Creates a 2D camera to control 2D layers with a parallax effect.
• Framing Guides: Grids and guides to help the composition of the image.
• Import TVPaint cam: Imports a 2D camera from TVPaint.
