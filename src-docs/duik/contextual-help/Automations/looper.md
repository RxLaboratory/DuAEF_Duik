Use the "Looper" to add in and out loops to the animations.

The looper works like the loopIn() and loopOut() expressions of After Effects, but with more options and easier to use.

With the Looper you can combine in and out loops, and activate and deactivate them at any time.

1. Select the properties
2. Click on the "Looper" button
