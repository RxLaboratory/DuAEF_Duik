The "Effector Map" is a way to control properties depending on a texture layer.

Like the connector, the effector map needs keyframes on the controlled property to work.

1. Animate the slave properties
2. Select the texture layer and click on "Pick texture layer"
3. Select the slave properties and click on the "Effector Map" button.
4. You can adjust the behaviour of the Effector Map in the effects of the texture layer.
