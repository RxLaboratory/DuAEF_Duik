Automations, automatic animations, dynamics, physics, procedural animation.

Duik includes a lot of tools to help animators deal with simple or common animations, to make them quicker and focus more on complex character animation.

- The "List" divides a property into several same properties, which can be mixed using a weight. This is a simple way to add several automations to the same property, or use some kind of "Animation Layer".
- The "Effector" is a way to control properties depending on a spatial effector.
- The "Wiggle" makes the properties... wiggle.
- The "Spring" will add "follow through"/"overlap"/"overshot" to your animations and it is able to animate automatic bounces.
- The "Swing" can be used to animate a regular swing. For example, the regular blinking of a light or a pendulum.
- Use the "Blink" to make a property switch regularly between to states, without interpolation.
- The "Wheel" automates the rotation of the layer depending on its translations.
- The "Move Away" tool will add a simple cursor which controls the position of the layer. This cursor will control the distance between the layer and its parent.
- The "Random" tool is able to randomize all kind of things (property values, keyframe times, layer times...)
- Use the "Paint Rig" to rig brush strokes in the paint effect and adjust and animate them as if they were a single stroke.
- The "Walk Cycle" is the first comprehensive procedural animation available in Duik.
- Use the "Looper" to add in and out loops to the animations.
