WARNING: never duplicate nor copy and paste structures in After Effects, always use the "Duplicate" button in the Structures panel of Duik.

## Hominoid

Hominoids (Hominoidea) are a branch of tailless anthropoid primates native to Africa and Southeast Asia.
They are distinguished from other primates by a wider degree of freedom of motion at the shoulder joint.
There are two extant branches of the superfamily Hominoidea: the gibbons, or lesser apes; and the hominids, or great apes (orangutans, gorillas, chimpanzees, humans).

This tool will create 'Structures' for a complete hominoid with a spine, two legs and two arms, using the settings of the individual limbs set in the 'Structures' panel.

[Alt+Click] on the button for a demo of what Duik can do!

## Arm

Create a 'Structure' for the arm or the front leg of a quadruped.

Click the '+' button to adjust the settings for the arm.

1. Select the type of limb you are rigging:
  - Plantigrade: Animals who put the whole foot on the ground, with the heel touching the ground when they walk. Includes primates, bears, rabbits... The ones nearly equal to humans.
  - Digitigrade: Animals who walk on their fingers. Includes dogs and all canines, cats and other felines, dinosaurs, walking birds... The friends of humans.
  - Ungulate: Animals who walk on the tip of their fingers, who usually have hoofs. Includes horses, cattle, giraffes, pigs, deers, camels, hippopotamuses... The ones humans eat.
2. You can check which part of the limb is present on your character. The autorig will adapt to every configuration, but using all of them (except for claws when rigging humans) can ensure a nice rig and a more realistic animation.


## Leg

Create a 'Structure' for the (back) leg of a biped or a quadruped.

Click the '+' button to adjust the settings for the leg.

1. Select the type of limb you are rigging:
  - Plantigrade: Animals who put the whole foot on the ground, with the heel touching the ground when they walk. Includes primates, bears, rabbits... The ones nearly equal to humans.
  - Digitigrade: Animals who walk on their fingers. Includes dogs and all canines, cats and other felines, dinosaurs, walking birds... The friends of humans.
  - Ungulate: Animals who walk on the tip of their fingers, who usually have hoofs. Includes horses, cattle, giraffes, pigs, deers, camels, hippopotamuses... The ones humans eat.
2. You can check which part of the limb is present on your character. The autorig will adapt to every configuration, but using all of them can ensure a nice rig and a more realistic animation (with a proper foot roll).

## Spine

Create a 'Structure' for the spine of any vertebrate.

Click the '+' button to adjust the settings for the spine.

You can check which part of the spine is present on your character.
You can divide the spine and the neck in as many layers as you want (or none).
The autorig will adapt to every configuration.

## Tail

Create a 'Structure' for the tail of any animal.

Click the '+' button to adjust the settings for the tail.

You can divide the tail in as many layers as you want.
The autorig will adapt to every configuration.

NOTE: In the Autorig options, you can choose between rigging tails using Bezier IK controls or FK (with automatic follow through and overlap) controls. The latter achieves a natural motion more easily, but IK could be needed in some cases, like if the tail interacts with anything else.

## Custom

Create a standard, custom Structure.

You can set the number of elements in the Structure, and choose a name for it.
