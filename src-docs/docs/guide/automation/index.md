# ![](../../img/duik/icons/automation.svg){style="width:1em;"} Automation and Expressions

Automations, automatic animations, dynamics, physics, procedural animation...

As soon as your character is rigged, you can begin the animation, being helped by a lot of Automations. **Automations** are procedural animations and dynamics to quickly set the most common animations up and then focus on the characterization of your character. You can automate wiggles, springs, wheels, etc. with customizable and advanced controls for example to loop the effects, and access each and every detail quickly and easily.
