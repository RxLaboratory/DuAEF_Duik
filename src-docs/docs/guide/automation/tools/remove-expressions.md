# ![](../../../img/duik/icons/disable_expression.svg){style="width:1em;"} Toggle Expressions

Select some properties with expressions and click the ![](../../../img/duik/icons/disable_expression.svg){style="width:1em;"} ***Toggle Expressions*** button to  quickly disable or re-enable the expressions.

Hold `[Ctrl]` to remove the expressions instead of deactivating them. To the contrary of After Effects, when you remove expressions with Duik, the current values of the properties are kept (the properties don't return to their initial, pre-expression value), unless you also hold the `[Alt]` key.
