# ![](../../img/duik/icons/swink.svg){style="width:1em;"} Swink

*Swink* stands for *swing or blink*[^pun]. It can be used to make a property oscillate between two values, with many options to control the interpolation[*](../../misc/glossary.md) between these values. For example, it makes it easy to animate a pendulum or a light blinking.

[^pun]: We've had a hard time translating this term in other languages, but we've found *Clignancement* for "Clignottement ou balancement" in French, and *Parpalancear* for "Parpadear o balancear" in Spanish. If you'd like to play with us and help translate Duik, come to  [translate.rxlab.io](http://translate.rxlab.io){target="_blank"}!

1. **Select** the properties
2. Click the ![](../../img/duik/icons/swink.svg){style="width:1em;"} ***Swink*** button  
    ![](../../img/duik/automation/swink-select.png)
3. **Choose** one of the presets

The choice between *Swing* or *Blink* just change the default values, the same effect is created in both cases.

!!! Tip
    When youâ€™ve applied the Swink on some properties and then want to use the same Swink on other properties, you can just copy and paste the expression in the new properties.

## Effect

The Swink can be adjusted in the effects of the first selected layer.

![](../../img/duik/automation/swink-effect.png)

Duik automatically sets the two values ***A*** and ***B*** to oscillate around the current value of the selected property. You can adjust these values as you wish, or even **animate them**.

While the ***frequency*** changes the speed of the oscillation, the ***Cycle offset*** moves the whole oscillation in time to let you adjust exactly the  value from which it starts at the beginning of the composition. This offset is set as a percentage of a complete cycle.

You can use the ***A/B ratio*** to let the oscillation spend more time on one or the other value. A ratio higher than `50 %` makes the time spent on the *A* value longer than on the *B* value, and vice versa.

When the ***Plateau*** is set to `0 %`, the oscillation never stops; with a higher value, the oscillation will stop some time on both values.

Finally, you can adjust the[ ***interpolation***](../../advanced/interpolation.md)&nbsp;[^interpo] between the *A* and *B* values:

[^interpo]: *cf. Advanced / [Interpolation](../../advanced/interpolation.md)*.

- *Hold (square)* disables interpolation. The value will *blink*.
- *Linear* will result in a very simple interpoation without easing (a triangle).
- *Smooth (sigmoid)* is the smoothest interpolation, similar to a sine function but with the ability to change the *easing* with the *Rate* value.  
    This interpolation is symetrical, like a sine function.
- *Natural (gaussian)* interpolates the value using the gaussian (*bell*) function, which results in an asymetrical acceleration and deceleration. With this interpolation, the motion is more dynamic, and the object looks alive; it is great for the arms swinging during a walk cycle for example.
- *Slow down (logarithmic)* makes the motion start as fast as possible and quickly slow down when getting to the other value.
- *Speed up (exponential)*  does the opposite of *Slow down*, making the motion start very slowly and speeding up as much as possible.

With the *Smooth*, *Natural*, *Slow down* and *Speed up* interpolations, you can use the ***Rate*** value to adjust the easing (acceleration and deceleration rate) of the motion.
