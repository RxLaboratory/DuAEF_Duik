# ![](../../../img/duik/icons/rename.svg){style="width:1em;"} Rename

With the Rename tool you can rename as many layers, puppet pins or project items at once as you wish.

This tool is able to update the expressions after having renamed the elements, if you need it. Disabling the option if you donâ€™t need it may improve performance a little bit.

!!! tip
    You can also use the [*Layer Manager*](../layers.md)&nbsp;[^layers] to manage the names and tags of the layers, following the Duik naming scheme for layers.

[^layers]: *cf [General Tools](../index.md) / [Layer Manager](../layers.md)*.
