After Effects lacks the ability to change the size of a precomposition without moving it in the composition where it is used.

Duik provides a quick and easy way to crop precompositions while keeping them at the location they are in the containing compositions.

1. **Draw a mask** with the pen tool to define the area to keep on the precomposition.  
    It doesn't have to be a rectangular mask but you should avoid curves and Bézier tangents.
2. Keep the precomposition selected, and click the ![](../../../img/duik/icons/crop.svg){style="width:1em;"} ***Crop precompositions*** button.  
    Duik crops the composition to the bounds of the mask.
3. You may **remove the mask** if you don't need it anymore.
