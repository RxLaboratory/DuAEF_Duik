# ![](../../../img/duik/icons/duplicate.svg){style="width:1em;"} Duplicate bones

Click this button to duplicate all the selected bones. You **must** use this button to duplicate armatures and be able to (auto-)rig them later, so that Duik can handle some hidden properties for you (like updating an identifier used to recognize limbs and armatures during the rig process).

!!! warning
    If you duplicate bones with *After Effects* (`[Ctrl] + [D]`), Duik won't be able to correctly rig them later.

Using this tool also keeps your timeline tidy as Duik will keep armatures grouped together, to the contrary of After Effects.
