- You can select keyframes at a specific time or in a time range.

- The time can be the time of the Current Time Indicator or a specific time, and the time range can be either the work area or a specific range.  
    To set specific time and time range, you can click on the eyedropper to pick the current values from the playhead or the work area.

- You can use the filters to select the keyframes of a specific type or on specific layers only.
