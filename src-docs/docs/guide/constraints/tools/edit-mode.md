# ![](../../../img/duik/icons/unlink.svg){style="width:1em;"} Edit Mode

Sometimes, you need to adjust the location of a specific layer, but you donâ€™t want to move all its children as well. In this case, with the layer(s) selected, toggle the *Edit Mode* using Duik.

Duik will automatically and temporarily unparent all children so you can easily relocate the layer, and then deactivate the edit mode.

When the edit mode is toggled, the layer turns red to warn you (using a *Tint* effect), and a marker is added, until you switch it off.
