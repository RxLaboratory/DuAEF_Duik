# ![](../../../img/duik/icons/move_anchor_point.svg){style="width:1em;"} Move Anchor Points

Moving (and perfectly aligning) anchor points can be a big pain in After Effects, especially if they've been animated or when moving multiple anchor points at once.

Use this tool to easily reposition the anchor points, even if there's an animation or on multiple layers at once.

Click the ***![](../../../img/duik/icons/move_anchor_point.svg){style="width:1em;"} Move Anchor Points*** button to access the tool.

1. **Select** some layers
2. **Click** one of the nine buttons of the panel.

If you include masks when moving the anchor point, instead of being aligned to the bounds of the layer, it will be aligned to the bounds of the BÃ©zier path of the mask.

Set a margin to offset the anchor point from the exact bounds.
