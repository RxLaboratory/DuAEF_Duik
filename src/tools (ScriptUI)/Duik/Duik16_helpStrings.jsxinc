For example, the regular blinking of a light or a pendulum.\n- Use the \"Blink\" to make a property switch regularly between to states, without interpolation.\n- The \"Wheel\" automates the rotation of the layer depending on its translations.\n- The \"Move Away\" tool will add a simple cursor which controls the position of the layer. This cursor will control the distance between the layer and its parent.\n- The \"Random\" tool is able to randomize all kind of things (property values, keyframe times, layer times...)\n- Use the \"Paint Rig\" to rig brush strokes in the paint effect and adjust and animate them as if they were a single stroke.\n- The \"Walk Cycle\" is the first comprehensive procedural animation available in Duik.\n- Use the \"Looper\" to add in and out loops to the animations.";

The other formats in the list are relatively common formats (some older, some more recent) which can be useful. The current standard for video is *16/9*, and for digital cinema they are *DCP Flat* and *DCP Scope*.\n• Format\nThis value lets you read the format of the selected preset, or set your own format if you've set the preset to *Custom*.\n• Appearance\nThe values in this group are used to adjust the appearance of the frame.\n• Computed Size (Read only)\nThis is the size of the resulting frame, in pixels.\n\n## Grids\n\nThe other effects are used to adjust the grids and guides.\n\nYou can have as many guides as you want, you just have to duplicate a grid effect to add a new one. The only limitation is that you cannot have twice the same type of grid or guide, but you can always duplicate the layer itself if you need.\n\nYou can temporarily hide a specific grid or guide by disabling the corresponding effect.\n\n• *Safe Frames* displays standard \"action\" and \"title\" safe frames, which represents resepectively 80% and 90% of the surface of the entire frame.\n• *Digital Frames* shows the standard digital formats (*4/3*, *16/9*, *1.85*, *2.35*) contained in the current frame. This way you can make sure your composition works even if the image is later cropped to another format.\n• *Golden Rectangle* divides the image using the golden ratio.\n• *Golden Fibonacci* draws the famous Fibonacci spiral, but adjusted using the golden ratio to fit the entire image.\n• *Real Fibonacci* draws the true Fibonacci spiral, with its accurate proportions.\n• *Isometric* draws an isometric guide very helpful when designing... isometric perspectives.";

var animationblendersetupHelp = "The Animation blender is a tool to animate using markers to trigger animations.\n\nTo use it, the animated properties or composition which you want to trigger with markers have to be set up.\nOnce they are ready, a simple tool in the Animation panel (Tools tab) of Duik can be used to easily set the markers to trigger animations.\n\nThere are two things which need to be set up: the animations, and the Blender itself.\nThe first part of the panel allows to quickly set the animations, while the second part is used to set the Blender up.\n\nBlender Animations\n\nAs soon as you have animated what you want to trigger, you have to set some markers to define when these animations begin and end. Each marker must have a name (which can be whatever you want), and a duration which is exactly the duration of your animation.\nWith versions of After Effects more recent than 14.0 (CC2017), these markers can be set on the composition itself, but with older versions, they have to be set on a layer named exactly \"Duik | Animation blender\".\nTo help you to set these markers, you can set their name in Duik, and then click the \"Set\" button. This will create a marker where it should be, using the work area of the composition to set its time and duration in a single click.\n\nBlender Setup\n\nSetting the composition up for the Blender is easy:\n1. Select the composition containing the animations you want to set up in the menu. You can use the eyedropper to quickly get the active composition.\n2. Select the composition from where you want to animate using the Animation Blender. It can be the same composition as the rigged one if you wish.\n3. You can choose to rig all animated properties, or only the selected ones. Setting only the selected properties up allows to have several controllers for the same composition, thus allowing to rig very complicating things...\n4. Click on the \"Blend!\" button to set everything up.\n\nUse\n\nTo use the blender, you just have to add markers on the controller layer. Each marker will trigger the corresponding animation.\nNote: their name have to be exactly the same, and it is case sensitive.\nA simple tool in the Animation panel (Tools tab) of Duik can be used to easily set these markers, but you can also do it directly inside After Effects (the the shorcuts below).\nThere are a few options in the effects of the controller, to loop the animation, and to control how they may blend during transitions. You can control if they have to blend, the duration of the transition (in seconds), and how it is interpolated.\n\nTo temporarily disable the Blender, you can disable the effect on the controller.

Select the layers to parent (the children), as you would with standard parenting in After Effects.\n2. In the panel of Duik, select the composition containing the layer which you want to be the parent. In the list, only containing and precompositions of the current composition will be displayed.

There is a simple way to prevent this:\n1. Create a null layer.\n2. Set its transformations to be exactly the same as those of the precomposition layer - including the anchor point. You can copy and paste them to do it quickly.\n3. Parent all locators to this new null layer instead of the precomposition layer.\n4. Now you can precompose the precomposition :)\n\n====\n\nStandard and Expert mode only:\n\nLocators, which are used by the \"Parent accross compositions\" tool, can be very useful in some cases. They are null layers which follow another layer no matter what and get all its transformations.\n\nYou can add a locator in a composition at any time, and the \"Extract locators\" button will extract all locators from a selected precomposition layer to make them available directly inside the main (parent) composition.

var riggingHelp = "To make the rigging process easier and more versatile in After Effects, Duik Bassel introduces the 'Structures' which are very similar to bones or joints in 3D softwares.\n\nStructures are layers you can add in your composition which will drive the animations, like the rig of a real puppet. The process is very simple: create or import your design in After Effects, add Structures and move them to the right spots (the pivots of each limb). Then you can rig those Structures, instead of the design itself like in previous versions of Duik, and finally link the design layers to the corresponding Structure layers.\n\nThis way, the rig you create is independant from the design. This means it’s easier to adjust the design even after the rig has been made, or even to re-use the same rig with other designs. Also, this rigging process is easier to fix or change if ever you need to adjust it even when you’re already in the process of animation.\n\nUsing the autorig, and a set of constraints, what you end with are controllers to drive the animation. You animate the controllers, they drive the structures through the constraints, and voilà! Your character moves.\n\nThe interaction between the controllers and the Structures, and between the Structures themselves, happens through some constraints. Some of them are the core tools of Duik since the first version, like IK which drive the bending of limbs, and the Bones which are used to control any spatial properties: puppet pins, the emitter of a particle effect, and, with CC2018 and newer versions of After Effects, any bezier value, like shapes or masks.\n\nThere is also a whole new set of constraints to automate even more movements and make the animator’s life very easier: it’s now possible to animate parenting with the new Parent Link constraint, or to constrain a layer to a bezier path, to attach a layer to other layers using weights, etc.\n\nThe rigging panel is divided into categories corresponding to this rigging process:\n\n- Structures: create and edit structures.\n- Constraints: (auto-)rig the structures, with IKs, the connector, parent links, bones, constraints...\n- Automations: add some automatic motion to properties (wiggle, spring...)\n- Controllers: create and edit nice and easy-to-use controllers.\n- Miscellaneous tools: renaming items, searching and replacing texts... is no longer a pain in After Effects.";

You can also simply copy this file to any other computer to transfer the settings.\n\n- You can change the language of Duik to one of the available ones, or you can contribute with your own translation (https://github.com/Rainbox-dev/DuAEF_Duik/wiki/Translation).\n\n- There are three different modes for the user interface, depending on your level:\n  - 'Rookie' is the simplest one, recommended if this is the first time you use Duik Bassel. Only the most used and simplest tools are available, and the user interface is thought to be as easy to use as possible.\n  - 'Standard' has all the tools available, in a nice and easy-to-use user interface.\n  - 'Expert' is the smallest mode, and may be a bit more complex to use as there are less texts to explain what do the buttons do.\n\n- You can switch between a 'Normal mode' and a 'Dev & Debug mode'. You should always stay in 'Normal mode' unless you're making changes in the code of Duik or if you have been asked to in order to find the source of a bug.\n\n- Click on the 'Apply changes' button to apply any change you've made in the settings. You can also close and open Duik again if anything seems to go wrong.";

var auditionHelp = "If you have some layers with audio in After Effects, you can export the audio to Audition using this tool.\n\nDuik will build a multi-track session in Audition, creating one clip for each layer with audio in the composition. Audio in precomposition is not supported (yet).\nAudio levels and their keyframes will be transfered to audition too, but if the channels (left and right) do not have the same levels, only the average level will be set in Audition.\n\n- Audio Active Only: check this to export only the layers with audio enabled. If it is unchecked, muted layers will be exported too.\n- Transcode and conform media: if this button is checked, Duik will use ffmpeg to extract audio from videos and conform the files before importing them in Audition. This is the best way to import any format, but the media files used in Audition will not be the same than the media files used in After Effects. There is no loss of quality, as Duik will create uncompressed PCM audio (*.wav) matchnig your settings.\n- Open session in Audition will automatically launch Audition and open the file after the export is complete.\n\nWhen you click the 'Export' button, you will be asked to save the Audition session file (*.sesx).

It can be a game engine, another animation software, conversion to a web animation format... It's up to you, if you know a little bit about writing scripts.\nThe format is not yet documented, but easy to understand just by reading the file.

var structuresHelp = "'Structures' are layers you can add in your composition which will drive the animations, like the rig of a real puppet. The process is very simple: create or import your design in After Effects, add Structures and move them to the right spots (the pivots of each limb). Then you can rig those Structures, instead of the design itself like in previous versions of Duik, and finally parent the design layers to the corresponding Structure layers.\n\nThis way, the rig you create is independant from the design. This means it’s easier to adjust the design even after the rig has been made, or even to re-use the same rig with other designs. Also, this rigging process is easier to fix or change if ever you need to adjust it even when you’re already in the process of animation.\n\n == Tools ==\n\n • Hominoid: creates a standard biped 'Structure'.\n • Arm: creates an arm 'Structure'.\n • Leg: creates a leg 'Structure'.\n • Spine: creates a 'Structure' for hips, spine parts, neck parts and head.\n • Custom: creates a custom 'Structures'.\n\n • Toggle edit mode (Normal and Expert mode): disables the parenting of all the children of the selected 'Structure' element to be able to move it without affecting the other elements.\n • Select structures: selects all 'Structures' found in the composition.\n • Show/hide: Shows or hides all (or selected) 'Structures' found in the composition.\n\n • Edit...
