var cameraHelp = "Good animation needs a good camera. The camera has to be considered as one of the characters of the animation, and its animation has to be as detailed as the animation of the characters the spectator see in the image.\nThis is the reason why Duik has useful camera tools too.\n\n== Tools ==\n\n• Camera rig: Rigs a 3D camera with useful controllers.\n• Scale Z-Link: a tool to move layers on the Z axis without changing their apparent size.\n• 2D Camera: Creates a 2D camera to control 2D layers with a parallax effect.\n• Framing Guides: Grids and guides to help the composition of the image.\n• Import TVPaint cam: Imports a 2D camera from TVPaint.";

var framingguidesHelp = "\"Framing Guides\" is a very simple tool which creates different types of grids and guides on a Shape Layer, which you can extensively configure, to help the composition of the image.\n\n## Frame\n\nThe first effect added to the layer lets you configure the frame.\n\n• Format presets\n   1. *Custom* lets you specify the format using the *Format* value.\n   2. *Composition* will compute the current aspect ratio of the composition, so you can know what it is in the *Format* value.\n   3. The other formats in the list are relatively common formats (some older, some more recent) which can be useful. The current standard for video is *16/9*, and for digital cinema they are *DCP Flat* and *DCP Scope*.\n• Format\nThis value lets you read the format of the selected preset, or set your own format if you've set the preset to *Custom*.\n• Appearance\nThe values in this group are used to adjust the appearance of the frame.\n• Computed Size (Read only)\nThis is the size of the resulting frame, in pixels.\n\n## Grids\n\nThe other effects are used to adjust the grids and guides.\n\nYou can have as many guides as you want, you just have to duplicate a grid effect to add a new one. The only limitation is that you cannot have twice the same type of grid or guide, but you can always duplicate the layer itself if you need.\n\nYou can temporarily hide a specific grid or guide by disabling the corresponding effect.\n\n• *Safe Frames* displays standard \"action\" and \"title\" safe frames, which represents resepectively 80% and 90% of the surface of the entire frame.\n• *Digital Frames* shows the standard digital formats (*4/3*, *16/9*, *1.85*, *2.35*) contained in the current frame. This way you can make sure your composition works even if the image is later cropped to another format.\n• *Golden Rectangle* divides the image using the golden ratio.\n• *Golden Fibonacci* draws the famous Fibonacci spiral, but adjusted using the golden ratio to fit the entire image.\n• *Real Fibonacci* draws the true Fibonacci spiral, with its accurate proportions.\n• *Isometric* draws an isometric guide very helpful when designing... isometric perspectives.";

var animationblendersetupHelp = "The Animation blender is a tool to animate using markers to trigger animations.\n\nTo use it, the animated properties or composition which you want to trigger with markers have to be set up.\nOnce they are ready, a simple tool in the Animation panel (Tools tab) of Duik can be used to easily set the markers to trigger animations.\n\nThere are two things which need to be set up: the animations, and the Blender itself.\nThe first part of the panel allows to quickly set the animations, while the second part is used to set the Blender up.\n\nBlender Animations\n\nAs soon as you have animated what you want to trigger, you have to set some markers to define when these animations begin and end. Each marker must have a name (which can be whatever you want), and a duration which is exactly the duration of your animation.\nWith versions of After Effects more recent than 14.0 (CC2017), these markers can be set on the composition itself, but with older versions, they have to be set on a layer named exactly \"Duik | Animation blender\".\nTo help you to set these markers, you can set their name in Duik, and then click the \"Set\" button. This will create a marker where it should be, using the work area of the composition to set its time and duration in a single click.\n\nBlender Setup\n\nSetting the composition up for the Blender is easy:\n1. Select the composition containing the animations you want to set up in the menu. You can use the eyedropper to quickly get the active composition.\n2. Select the composition from where you want to animate using the Animation Blender. It can be the same composition as the rigged one if you wish.\n3. You can choose to rig all animated properties, or only the selected ones. Setting only the selected properties up allows to have several controllers for the same composition, thus allowing to rig very complicating things...\n4. Click on the \"Blend!\" button to set everything up.\n\nUse\n\nTo use the blender, you just have to add markers on the controller layer. Each marker will trigger the corresponding animation.\nNote: their name have to be exactly the same, and it is case sensitive.\nA simple tool in the Animation panel (Tools tab) of Duik can be used to easily set these markers, but you can also do it directly inside After Effects (the the shorcuts below).\nThere are a few options in the effects of the controller, to loop the animation, and to control how they may blend during transitions. You can control if they have to blend, the duration of the transition (in seconds), and how it is interpolated.\n\nTo temporarily disable the Blender, you can disable the effect on the controller. This makes it easy to add new animations or modifiy the existing ones.\n\n== Shortcuts for markers in After Effects ==\n\nNote that some of these shortcuts were not available in all versions of After Effects, but were added in the latest versions.\n\nâ€¢ [*] adds a new marker on the selected layer, or on the composition without any selected layer.\nâ€¢ [Alt + *] opens the marker editor window before adding the marker, where you can set a comment.\nâ€¢ [Alt + Click] on a marker changes its duration.\nâ€¢ [Ctrl + Click] on a marker removes it.\nâ€¢ [Shift + 1/2/3...9] adds a marker with the corresponding number as its comment.";

Audio in precomposition is not supported (yet).\nAudio levels and their keyframes will be transfered to audition too, but if the channels (left and right) do not have the same levels, only the average level will be set in Audition.\n\n- Audio Active Only: check this to export only the layers with audio enabled. If it is unchecked, muted layers will be exported too.\n- Transcode and conform media: if this button is checked, Duik will use ffmpeg to extract audio from videos and conform the files before importing them in Audition. This is the best way to import any format, but the media files used in Audition will not be the same than the media files used in After Effects. There is no loss of quality, as Duik will create uncompressed PCM audio (*.wav) matchnig your settings.\n- Open session in Audition will automatically launch Audition and open the file after the export is complete.\n\nWhen you click the 'Export' button, you will be asked to save the Audition session file (*.sesx).

var structuresHelp = "'Structures' are layers you can add in your composition which will drive the animations, like the rig of a real puppet. The process is very simple: create or import your design in After Effects, add Structures and move them to the right spots (the pivots of each limb). Then you can rig those Structures, instead of the design itself like in previous versions of Duik, and finally parent the design layers to the corresponding Structure layers.\n\nThis way, the rig you create is independant from the design. This means it’s easier to adjust the design even after the rig has been made, or even to re-use the same rig with other designs. Also, this rigging process is easier to fix or change if ever you need to adjust it even when you’re already in the process of animation.\n\n == Tools ==\n\n • Hominoid: creates a standard biped 'Structure'.\n • Arm: creates an arm 'Structure'.\n • Leg: creates a leg 'Structure'.\n • Spine: creates a 'Structure' for hips, spine parts, neck parts and head.\n • Custom: creates a custom 'Structures'.\n\n • Toggle edit mode (Normal and Expert mode): disables the parenting of all the children of the selected 'Structure' element to be able to move it without affecting the other elements.\n • Select structures: selects all 'Structures' found in the composition.\n • Show/hide: Shows or hides all (or selected) 'Structures' found in the composition.\n\n • Edit...
