var animationblendersetupHelp = "The Animation blender is a tool to animate using markers to trigger animations.\n\nTo use it, the animated properties or composition which you want to trigger with markers have to be set up.\nOnce they are ready, a simple tool in the Animation panel (Tools tab) of Duik can be used to easily set the markers to trigger animations.\n\nThere are two things which need to be set up: the animations, and the Blender itself.\nThe first part of the panel allows to quickly set the animations, while the second part is used to set the Blender up.\n\nBlender Animations\n\nAs soon as you have animated what you want to trigger, you have to set some markers to define when these animations begin and end. Each marker must have a name (which can be whatever you want), and a duration which is exactly the duration of your animation.\nWith versions of After Effects more recent than 14.0 (CC2017), these markers can be set on the composition itself, but with older versions, they have to be set on a layer named exactly \"Duik | Animation blender\".\nTo help you to set these markers, you can set their name in Duik, and then click the \"Set\" button. This will create a marker where it should be, using the work area of the composition to set its time and duration in a single click.\n\nBlender Setup\n\nSetting the composition up for the Blender is easy:\n1. Select the composition containing the animations you want to set up in the menu. You can use the eyedropper to quickly get the active composition.\n2. Select the composition from where you want to animate using the Animation Blender. It can be the same composition as the rigged one if you wish.\n3. You can choose to rig all animated properties, or only the selected ones. Setting only the selected properties up allows to have several controllers for the same composition, thus allowing to rig very complicating things...\n4. Click on the \"Blend!\" button to set everything up.\n\nUse\n\nTo use the blender, you just have to add markers on the controller layer. Each marker will trigger the corresponding animation.\nNote: their name have to be exactly the same, and it is case sensitive.\nA simple tool in the Animation panel (Tools tab) of Duik can be used to easily set these markers, but you can also do it directly inside After Effects (the the shorcuts below).\nThere are a few options in the effects of the controller, to loop the animation, and to control how they may blend during transitions. You can control if they have to blend, the duration of the transition (in seconds), and how it is interpolated.\n\nTo temporarily disable the Blender, you can disable the effect on the controller. This makes it easy to add new animations or modifiy the existing ones.\n\n== Shortcuts for markers in After Effects ==\n\nNote that some of these shortcuts were not available in all versions of After Effects, but were added in the latest versions.\n\nâ€¢ [*] adds a new marker on the selected layer, or on the composition without any selected layer.\nâ€¢ [Alt + *] opens the marker editor window before adding the marker, where you can set a comment.\nâ€¢ [Alt + Click] on a marker changes its duration.\nâ€¢ [Ctrl + Click] on a marker removes it.\nâ€¢ [Shift + 1/2/3...9] adds a marker with the corresponding number as its comment.";

There is a simple way to prevent this:\n1. Create a null layer.\n2. Set its transformations to be exactly the same as those of the precomposition layer - including the anchor point. You can copy and paste them to do it quickly.\n3. Parent all locators to this new null layer instead of the precomposition layer.\n4.

var riggingHelp = "To make the rigging process easier and more versatile in After Effects, Duik Bassel introduces the 'Structures' which are very similar to bones or joints in 3D softwares.\n\nStructures are layers you can add in your composition which will drive the animations, like the rig of a real puppet. The process is very simple: create or import your design in After Effects, add Structures and move them to the right spots (the pivots of each limb). Then you can rig those Structures, instead of the design itself like in previous versions of Duik, and finally link the design layers to the corresponding Structure layers.\n\nThis way, the rig you create is independant from the design. This means it’s easier to adjust the design even after the rig has been made, or even to re-use the same rig with other designs. Also, this rigging process is easier to fix or change if ever you need to adjust it even when you’re already in the process of animation.\n\nUsing the autorig, and a set of constraints, what you end with are controllers to drive the animation. You animate the controllers, they drive the structures through the constraints, and voilà! Your character moves.\n\nThe interaction between the controllers and the Structures, and between the Structures themselves, happens through some constraints. Some of them are the core tools of Duik since the first version, like IK which drive the bending of limbs, and the Bones which are used to control any spatial properties: puppet pins, the emitter of a particle effect, and, with CC2018 and newer versions of After Effects, any bezier value, like shapes or masks.\n\nThere is also a whole new set of constraints to automate even more movements and make the animator’s life very easier: it’s now possible to animate parenting with the new Parent Link constraint, or to constrain a layer to a bezier path, to attach a layer to other layers using weights, etc.\n\nThe rigging panel is divided into categories corresponding to this rigging process:\n\n- Structures: create and edit structures.\n- Constraints: (auto-)rig the structures, with IKs, the connector, parent links, bones, constraints...\n- Automations: add some automatic motion to properties (wiggle, spring...)\n- Controllers: create and edit nice and easy-to-use controllers.\n- Miscellaneous tools: renaming items, searching and replacing texts... is no longer a pain in After Effects.";
