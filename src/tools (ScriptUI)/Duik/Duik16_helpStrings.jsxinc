var structuresHelp = "'Structures' are layers you can add in your composition which will drive the animations, like the rig of a real puppet. The process is very simple: create or import your design in After Effects, add Structures and move them to the right spots (the pivots of each limb). Then you can rig those Structures, instead of the design itself like in previous versions of Duik, and finally parent the design layers to the corresponding Structure layers.\n\nThis way, the rig you create is independant from the design. This means it’s easier to adjust the design even after the rig has been made, or even to re-use the same rig with other designs. Also, this rigging process is easier to fix or change if ever you need to adjust it even when you’re already in the process of animation.\n\n == Tools ==\n\n • Hominoid: creates a standard biped 'Structure'.\n • Arm: creates an arm 'Structure'.\n • Leg: creates a leg 'Structure'.\n • Spine: creates a 'Structure' for hips, spine parts, neck parts and head.\n • Custom: creates a custom 'Structures'.\n\n • Toggle edit mode (Normal and Expert mode): disables the parenting of all the children of the selected 'Structure' element to be able to move it without affecting the other elements.\n • Select structures: selects all 'Structures' found in the composition.\n • Show/hide: Shows or hides all (or selected) 'Structures' found in the composition.\n\n • Edit... (Normal and Expert mode): opens the edition panel for 'Structures'.";
