// ==== Camera ====

var cameraHelp = "Good animation needs a good camera. The camera has to be considered as one of the characters of the animation, and its animation has to be as detailed as the animation of the characters the spectator see in the image.\nThis is the reason why Duik has useful camera tools too.\n\n== Tools ==\n\n• Camera rig: Rigs a 3D camera with useful controllers.\n• Scale Z-Link: a tool to move layers on the Z axis without changing their apparent size.\n• 2D Camera: Creates a 2D camera to control 2D layers with a parallax effect.\n• Framing Guides: Grids and guides to help the composition of the image.\n• Import TVPaint cam: Imports a 2D camera from TVPaint.";

var framingguidesHelp = "\"Framing Guides\" is a very simple tool which creates different types of grids and guides on a Shape Layer, which you can extensively configure, to help the composition of the image.\n\n## Frame\n\nThe first effect added to the layer lets you configure the frame.\n\n• Format presets\n   1. *Custom* lets you specify the format using the *Format* value.\n   2. *Composition* will compute the current aspect ratio of the composition, so you can know what it is in the *Format* value.\n   3. The other formats in the list are relatively common formats (some older, some more recent) which can be useful. The current standard for video is *16/9*, and for digital cinema they are *DCP Flat* and *DCP Scope*.\n• Format\nThis value lets you read the format of the selected preset, or set your own format if you've set the preset to *Custom*.\n• Appearance\nThe values in this group are used to adjust the appearance of the frame.\n• Computed Size (Read only)\nThis is the size of the resulting frame, in pixels.\n\n## Grids\n\nThe other effects are used to adjust the grids and guides.\n\nYou can have as many guides as you want, you just have to duplicate a grid effect to add a new one. The only limitation is that you cannot have twice the same type of grid or guide, but you can always duplicate the layer itself if you need.\n\nYou can temporarily hide a specific grid or guide by disabling the corresponding effect.\n\n• *Safe Frames* displays standard \"action\" and \"title\" safe frames, which represents resepectively 80% and 90% of the surface of the entire frame.\n• *Digital Frames* shows the standard digital formats (*4/3*, *16/9*, *1.85*, *2.35*) contained in the current frame. This way you can make sure your composition works even if the image is later cropped to another format.\n• *Golden Rectangle* divides the image using the golden ratio.\n• *Golden Fibonacci* draws the famous Fibonacci spiral, but adjusted using the golden ratio to fit the entire image.\n• *Real Fibonacci* draws the true Fibonacci spiral, with its accurate proportions.\n• *Isometric* draws an isometric guide very helpful when designing... isometric perspectives.";

var structuresHelp = "'Structures' are layers you can add in your composition which will drive the animations, like the rig of a real puppet. The process is very simple: create or import your design in After Effects, add Structures and move them to the right spots (the pivots of each limb). Then you can rig those Structures, instead of the design itself like in previous versions of Duik, and finally parent the design layers to the corresponding Structure layers.\n\nThis way, the rig you create is independant from the design. This means it’s easier to adjust the design even after the rig has been made, or even to re-use the same rig with other designs. Also, this rigging process is easier to fix or change if ever you need to adjust it even when you’re already in the process of animation.\n\n == Tools ==\n\n • Hominoid: creates a standard biped 'Structure'.\n • Arm: creates an arm 'Structure'.\n • Leg: creates a leg 'Structure'.\n • Spine: creates a 'Structure' for hips, spine parts, neck parts and head.\n • Custom: creates a custom 'Structures'.\n\n • Toggle edit mode (Normal and Expert mode): disables the parenting of all the children of the selected 'Structure' element to be able to move it without affecting the other elements.\n • Select structures: selects all 'Structures' found in the composition.\n • Show/hide: Shows or hides all (or selected) 'Structures' found in the composition.\n\n • Edit... (Normal and Expert mode): opens the edition panel for 'Structures'.";
