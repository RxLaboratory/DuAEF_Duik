var keyframetoolsHelp = "The 'Keys' panel contains all tools you may need all the time when in the process of animation.\n\n## Select Keyframes\n\n'Select keyframes...' is a very useful tool to quickly select a lot of keyframes together in the timeline.\n\n- You can select keyframes at a specific time or in a time range.\n\n- The time can be the time of the playhead or a specific time, and the time range can be either the work area or a specific range. To set specific time and time range, you can click on the eyedropper to pick the current values from the playhead or the work area.\n\n- You can use the filters to select the keyframes of a specific type or on specific layers only.\n\n## Interpolations\n\nJust under the ‘Select keyframes’ button, there are several tools to quickly adjust the interpolations of the selected keyframes.\n\n- The first line of buttons can be used to change the interpolation type of the keyframes, or add keyframes of the wanted type on the properties. With the first button on the left, you can switch between the ‘Edit’ mode and the ‘Add key’ mode.\n- In Standard Mode (only), you can manage some interpolation presets, which store and reset velocity and ease.\n- The two sliders and the percentage adjust the ease on the selected keyframes, while the value just below defines the velocity.\n\n## Kleaner\n\nThe \"Kleaner\" is a tool to automatically clean the selected animations. It is able to remove unneeded keyframes, clean the interpolations, etc.\n\n### Description\n\nIt works both on spatial interpolations and keyframe eases, in three default steps:\n\n1. Fix spatial interpolation: the \"Kleaner\" will detect spatial tangents which should not be there, for example when two successive keyframes are exactly at the same place but with tangents between them.\n2. Smooth temporal interpolations. The \"Kleaner\" will adjust the animation curves to make them as smooth as possible, automatically detecting the best velocities and eases. It works a bit like the \"Auto-Bezier\" feature in After Effects but... better.\n3. The \"Kleaner\" will remove all unnecessary keyframes, keeping the exact same animation but with less keys.\n\n### Use\n\n1. Select the keyframes of the animation you want to clean.\n2. Click on the \"Kleaner\" button.\n\n### Additionnal Panel\n\nThe additionnal panel is divided in three sections corresponding to the three steps of the \"Kleaner \" process.\n\n- Spatial Interpolations:\n  The four leftmost buttons can be used to quickly change the tangents of several spatial keyframes at once.\n  Check or uncheck the checkbox to activate or deactivate this step when you run the \"Kleaner\"\n- Temporal interpolation smoothing:\n  Use the two leftmost buttons to tell the \"Kleaner\" if the first and last keyframes of the animation have to be linear or with ease.\n  Check or uncheck the checkbox to activate or deactivate this step when you run the \"Kleaner\"\n- Remove unnecessary keyframes:\n  Check or uncheck the checkbox to activate or deactivate this step when you run the \"Kleaner\"\n\n## Copy / Paste animation\n\nYou can copy and paste animations from several layers at once, and from one composition to another.\n\nBy default, the Copy and Paste tools will work exactly like the default copying and pasting in After Effects (except it works on several layers at once).\n\nIf, when pasting, Duik can not find any corresponding layer to paste some properties, you will be prompted to choose (or ignore) the layers yourself. The dialog will show the names of the missing layers along with some selectors to set the layers where to paste the animations.\n\n### Additionnal panel\n\nSome options make this tool very powerful and more than just a standard copy and paste process.\n\n- You can choose between pasting absolute or relative values. Absolute will paste the keyframes as they are, but Relative will offset the values before pasting, depending on the current values of the properties.\n\n- You can reverse the keyframes in time each time you paste them, to make it easier to loop some keyframes in \"ping pong\" mode.\n\n- You can automatically replace all existing keyframes, removing any pre-existing animation before pasting.";

Select the layer(s)\n2. Click on the \"Motion Trail\" button\n\nA \"Motion Trail\" layer is added to the comp. It is a shape layer used to draw the trails. An effect is added on this layer for each motion trail created.\n\n## Effect\n\nUse the effects of the \"Motion Trail\" layer to adjust all the trails.\n\n- The \"Motion source\" is the layer used to draw the trail.\n\n- You can set the in and out (in frames relative to the current time) to adjust the length of the trail.\n  Note: long trails can have a big impact on the performance.\n\n- By default, the motion is sampled each frame of the composition. If the movement is very fast, you might want more samples for a smoother trail. In this case, you can switch to Automatic sampling which will try to adjust depending on the velocity and choose the best sampling while trying to keep better performance, or sub-frame sampling which is the heavier way to sample the motion.\n  In Automtic and sub-frame sampling you can adjust the number of samples, which directly impacts the quality of the trail but can have a big impact on performance too.\n\n- In the display section, you can change and animate basic appearance settings. Keep in mind that \"Motion trails\" are standard shape layers and you can do much more with them by modifying yourself the content.\n\n## Additionnal panel\n\nIn the additionnal panel, you can choose to create a new layer when you create new motion trails, or to add them all on the existing layer if any.\nYou can also set the color of new motion trails.\n\n## For more details, read the comprehensive user guide available at duik-docs.rainboxprod.coop";

var xsheetHelp = "'X-Sheet' is a simple way to adjust the animation exposure of the properties, the layers or the whole composition.\n\nThis is a very useful tool if you are compositing traditionnal animation or trying to achieve a traditionnal look on CG animations.\nIt can change the framerate of the composition or of the properties at any time, mixing framerates (what's called the \"exposure\" in traditionnal animation) in the same composition, for different layers or at different times.\n\n## Setup\n\nYou can use the X-Sheet either as an adjustment layer for the whole comp, or on properties.\n\nTo use it as an adjustment layer, just click on the \"X-Sheet\" button. To add it on properties, select the properties before clicking in the button.\n\n## Effect\n\nThere are four ways to adjust the exposure of the animations / the compostion.\n\n- By Frame Duration: This way, you just have to set the exposure with the \"Frame Duration\" value. For example, setting this value to 2 in a 24fps comp will run the animation at 12fps, setting in to 3 in the same comp will run it at 8fps.\n  This value can be animated to change the exposure at any time.\n\nThe three other methods do not use an exposure / framerate value, but keyframes or markers to set the times when the frame must change. This allows a very precise control on the exposure, and works like a X-Sheet in traditionnal animation.\n\n- The \"X-sheet\" method uses keyframes on the \"X-Sheet\" value of the effect: it will change the frame at each keyframe on the checkbox, no matter the value of the checkbox itself (it does not matter to check or uncheck it, it is only the time of the keyframe which is used).\n\n- The last two methods works the same way but using composition or layer markers instead of keyframes. The displayed frame will be changed at each marker time.\n\n## Additionnal panel\n\n- You can use the additionnal panel to set an option to try to auto-detect the best exposure for selected properties to achieve a nice traditionnal look. This feature is a bit experimental but may work well with the most simple animations.";

If the property slows down before stopping (with a Bezier ease), there can not be any bounce.\n\nIt can be adjusted in the effects of the corresponding layer.\n\nThe elasticity controls both the amplitude and the frequency of the motion. A Higher elasticity will result in a higher frequency but lower amplitude.\n\nThe damping controls how long it takes for the property to stop to move.\n\nIf the spring is set on a spatial property, there are two ways to compute it:\n- Basic: the computation is made with the keyframes of the property itself.\n- Simulation: the computation is made with the actual motion of the layer. This is heavier to compute, but it does not need any keyframe on the layer, it is its actual translation which is used, even if its from a parent layer.\n\nIf the spring is set on a simple value (with only one dimension), you can set it to \"bounce\". This means that instead of swinging around the stopping value, it will bounce against it.

var walkcycleHelp = "The \"Walk Cycle\" is the first comprehensive procedural animation available in Duik Bassel.\n\nTo use the walk cycle, you must have a rigged character.\n\nNOTE: In the Structures panel, [Alt + Click] on the \"Hominoid\" button will create a complete biped with a demo walk cycle.\n\nNOTE: This walk cycle was made for bipeds, but you can achieve a quadruped walkcycle using two walk cycles: one for the front legs, shoulders, neck and head, and another one for the back legs and hips. You only have to animate the tail by yourself.\n\n## Setup\n\nBefore creating the walk cycle, make sure the character is standing straight, with the arms along the body, in a natural pose.\nYou will still be able to move the controllers after the walk cycle has been created to adjust the pose and the look of the walk, or even animate them above the automatic animation to adjust it.\nThe walk cycle is not meant to create perfect and characteroized animation. It is a tool useful to get started quickly with walk animations which would need some tweaks to characterize them, or to animate quickly secondary, less important, characters.\n\nIf the character was rigged by predefined limb Structures and the Auto-rig of Duik, using the walkcycle is pretty straightforward:\n\n1. Select all the controllers of the character\n2. Click on the \"Walk Cycle button\"\n\nIf the character was rigged using custom Structures in Duik, or any other tool (Rubberhose, BAO Bones...) or even custom expressions, you can also use the walk cycle, but you will have to make some easy connections:\n\n1. Select all the controllers of the character (the layers used to animate it, or which contain the effects needed to animate it)\n2. Open the additionnal panel for the Walk cycle\n3. Assign the layers to their corresponding limbs. The eyedropper will set the currently selected layer in the composition.\n4. a. Click on the \"Create\" button\n    b. Duik will try to link the properties of the controllers to the walk cycle, but if you are using custom rigs, it may not find them all, in this case, read the effect description below to see how you can connect them manually.\n\nThe Walk Cycle can be adjusted in the effects of the walk cycle controller which has been created in the composition.\n\n## Effect\n\nNOTE: all controllers can still be animated, so you can add your own keyframes to adjust the animation to your taste or animate anything else. Feel free to move the controllers to adjust the pose of the character.\n\n- The \"General motion\" value can be used to start and stop the walk cycle. You can then animate the character as you would without the walk cycle tool to continue the animation before or after the walk.\n\n- The \"Main parameters\" set the general information needed by the walk cycle to animate it correctly\n\n- The \"secondary controls\" are used to tweak each individual limb motion\n\n- The \"Animation data\" is where you can connect custom controllers to the walk cycle, get data to use in your own expressions and rigs, and adjust some parameters needed for the computation.\n\n### Main Parameters\n\nAll parameters use the metric system for now. Future versions of Duik will let you choose between the metric system and imperial units.\n\n- \"Character\": sets the main traits of the character.\n  - Its height influences the frequency of the cycle (the apparent speed of the feet).\n  - Its weight mainly influences the accelerations and decelerations of the motion (the momentum).\n  - The energy controls the amplitude of the movements.\n  - The softness controls how the muscles are contracted or not.\n- \"Walk Cycle\": sets the characteristics of the walk.\n  - The walk speed adjusts the speed of the character. This parameters changes the amplitude of the steps - it does not change the frequency of the cycle which depends on the height of the character. To change the direction of the cycle, change the sign of the speed.\n  - You can choose between to walk cycle types: realistic is the most natural, and dancing adds a \"double bounce\" like Mickey Mouse.\n\n### Secondary controls\n\nHere you can adjust how each individual limb moves. In this version of Duik, you can not control separately the left and the right, but if you need to differenciate each side, you can create two different versions of the walk cycle in the same composition, one for each side.\n\nYou can adjust the swinging amplitude the limbs, their softness (how the muscles are contracted), etc. Do not hesitate to test each control individually to see how it affects the walk cycle.\n\n### Animation data\n\nIn this section you can adjust how the walk cycle is computed, connect your custom rig and controllers which Duik could not connect automatically, or get useful data for your own rigs and expressions.\n\n#### Animation\n\nThis is where you can connect the properties of custom rigs and controllers.\nEach value in this section outputs the animation of the corresponding property on each limb.\nTo connect the properties of your controllers, use the expression pickwhip to pick the corresponding animation property, and add '+ value;' at the end of the resulting expression.\nThe arms animmation uses FK, you need to connect them to angle properties.\nThe feet animation uses IK, connect them to position properties.\n\n#### Parameters\n\nDuik tries to set some important parameters automatically when you create the walk cycle with some controllers selected, but if you are using a custom rig or if you connect controllers later, these properties may not be set properly. You can adjust them in this section.\n\n- Duik needs to know the height of the legs of the character as displayed in the composition, in pixels, from the heel to the hips, when the character is standing.\n\n- Duik also needs the height of the whole characer, in pixels, from the heel to the top of the head.\n\n#### Computation\n\nThis section outputs some values used by Duik to compute the walk cycle. You can use them in your own expressions and rigs.\n\nOne value is especially useful: the cycle duration, which is available in seconds or frames. To render perfect loops, you can set the work area or the composition duration to this value.";

Complexity and multiplier allows to have a \"fractal\" wiggle, and the random seed is used to generate the pseudo-randomness of the wiggle. This random seed is set to the index of the layer by default at the time the wiggle is created. On the contrary of the standard wiggle in After Effects, using this random seed allows to keep the wiggle as it is even if the layer is moved in the stack. To change the randomness, just change this seed.\n\nIn the additionnal panel of the wiggle, there are a few options:\n\n- \"Collapse dimensions\" adds a unique control for all axis, \"separate dimensions\" adds a set of controls for each axis.\n\n- \"Unique control\" creates a single effect for all selected properties, but \"individual controls\" creates an effect for each property.";

var animationblendersetupHelp = "The Animation blender is a tool to animate using markers to trigger animations.\n\nIn a composition, you can have several animations, one after each other.\nThe animation blender is a simple controller (a layer) where you add markers which will trigger these animations.\nThe animation blender is able to blend the animations together during transitions right after a marker, and it's also able to loop the animations after they have been triggered, if you need.\n\nTo use it, the animated properties or composition which you want to trigger with markers have to be set up.\nOnce they are ready, a simple tool in the Animation panel (Tools tab) of Duik can be used to easily set the markers to trigger animations.\n\nThere are two things which need to be set up: the animations, and the Blender itself.\nThe first part of the panel allows to quickly set the animations, while the second part is used to set the Blender up.\n\nBlender Animations\n\nAs soon as you have animated what you want to trigger, you have to set some markers to define when these animations begin and end. Each marker must have a name (which can be whatever you want), and a duration which is exactly the duration of your animation.\nWith versions of After Effects more recent than 14.0 (CC2017), these markers can be set on the composition itself, but with older versions, they have to be set on a layer named exactly \"Duik | Animation blender\".\nTo help you to set these markers, you can set their name in Duik, and then click the \"Set\" button. This will create a marker where it should be, using the work area of the composition to set its time and duration in a single click.\n\nBlender Setup\n\nSetting the composition up for the Blender is easy:\n1. Select the composition containing the animations you want to set up in the menu. You can use the eyedropper to quickly get the active composition.\n2. Select the composition from where you want to animate using the Animation Blender. It can be the same composition as the rigged one if you wish.\n3. You can choose to rig all animated properties, or only the selected ones. Setting only the selected properties up allows to have several controllers for the same composition, thus allowing to rig very complicating things...\n4. Click on the \"Blend!\" button to set everything up.\n\nUse\n\nTo use the blender, you just have to add markers on the controller layer. Each marker will trigger the corresponding animation.\nNote: their name have to be exactly the same, and it is case sensitive.\nA simple tool in the Animation panel (Tools tab) of Duik can be used to easily set these markers, but you can also do it directly inside After Effects (the the shorcuts below).\n\nThere are a few options in the effects of the controller, to loop the animation, and to control how they may blend during transitions. You can control if they have to blend, the duration of the transition (in seconds), and how it is interpolated.\n\nTo temporarily disable the Blender, you can disable the effect on the controller. This makes it easy to add new animations or modifiy the existing ones.\n\n== Shortcuts for markers in After Effects ==\n\nNote that some of these shortcuts were not available in all versions of After Effects, but were added in the latest versions.\n\n- [*] adds a new marker on the selected layer, or on the composition without any selected layer.\n- [Alt + *] opens the marker editor window before adding the marker, where you can set a comment.\n- [Alt + Click] on a marker changes its duration.\n- [Ctrl + Click] on a marker removes it.\n- [Shift + 1/2/3...9] adds a marker with the corresponding number as its comment.";

var autorigHelp = "The Auto-rig in Duik Bassel is a versatile and smart tool which adapts to a lot of different situations. This makes it the cornerstone of the rigging process in Duik, which can be summarized to \"Create Structures, Auto-rig, Link layers, Animate\".\n\nAs a smart tool, it will guess what you are trying to do, depending on the layers you have selected. It is able to add \"simple\" IK or to rig a complete character in a single click.\n\nNOTE: The Auto-rig is a tool in constant evolution. In each future version of Duik, it is going to work better and better, handling more different situations.\n\nUsing the Auto-rig\n\n1. Select some layers in the composition .\n2. Click the \"Auto-rig & IK\" button.\n\n- If there are Structures in the selection:\n\n  - If there are predefined limbs (arm, leg, spine or tail), the Auto-rig will rig everything for you, so you can start to animate right afterwards.\n\n  - If the Structures are custom Structures, the Auto-rig will add IKs to rig them, determining which type of IK would be the best according to the number and location of the layers.\n\n- If the selection is made of standard layers, the Auto-rig will add IKs to rig them, trying to guess how they need to be rigged using their parenting and the location of their anchor points. If the layers are not parented yet, the Auto-rig is able to parent them automatically, but it's better in this case to select the layers in the right order: from the tip to the root of the limb (from hand to shoulder, or from foot to hip...).\n\nControllers\n\nAs opposed to previous versions of Duik, the Auto-rig in Duik Bassel is able to create any needed controllers to rig the selected layers, you do not necessarily have to create them yourself first.\nThis being said, if you need or want to add and use a specific controller, you just have to include it in the layer selection before running the Auto-rig. It will automatically detect and use it. This is especially useful if, for example, you want to control two different IKs with the same controller.\n\nAlways have a look in the effects of the Controllers after having run the Auto-rig! Depending on what has been rigged, there may be a lot of options there.\n\nAdditionnal panel\n\nThe additionnal panel for the Auto-rig is divided in two parts: some options for the Auto-rig process itself, and some complementary tools.\n\nOptions\n\n- By default, the Auto-rig will \"bake\" the appearance of any Structure after it has rigged it. This is a way to improve performance in After Effects by removing all unneeded expressions, but it will prevent you from changing the appearance of the Structures after having run the Auto-rig. You can disable this option if you wish; baking the appearance of the Structures will still be possible through the \"Edit Structures\" panel (in Standard and Expert mode only).\n\n- For long limbs (more than two or three layers), the autorig has to choose between standard IK, Bezier IK or FK. The default is FK - it is easier to achieve a nice and natural motion using the FK with overlap of Duik - but you may need IK in some cases, especially if the limb interacts with something else. For example if the dog's tail is caught in the door. Ouch.\n\nComplementary tools (\"Standard\" and \"Expert\" modes)\n\n- The \"IK\" button may be needed in very special occasions when the Auto-rig is not able to automatically create IK.\nThere is an additionnal panel for the IK to let you choose how the IK for three layers have to be made:\n  - \"1 and 2-layer IK\" (the default option) creates a combination of a one-layer and two-layer IK to rig the three layers with only one controller. This is the preferred way of rigging complex limbs like quadrupeds legs, as it allows a lot of controllers over each part of the limb.\n  - \"3-layer IK\" creates a single IK for the three layers, which may seem easier to manipulate, but which is more limited in use.\n\n- \"Bezier IK\" creates a Bezier IK without using the Auto-rig. In normal situations, as soons as there are more than two layers, the Auto-Rig will create a Bezier IK, but in some cases you may need some Bezier IK for only one or two layers; in this case, you can use this tool instead.\n\n- \"FK Overlap\" rigs a chain of layers with a rotation controller (FK) with automatic follow-through and overlap.

var connectorHelp = "The Connector is a way to control almost any property in After Effects with any other property, a bit like parenting between layers, but with properties.\n\nWith the connector, a \"master property\" will drive one or several \"slave properties\" and automate their animation depending on the master property value.\n\nIt is very useful in two cases:\n- Every time you need a causal link between a property and some other properties. For example \"when the arm bends, the cloth has to adapt\": this means you can use the connector to drive the shape of the cloth with the rotation of the forearm.\n- It is very powerful to quickly connect sliders and other controllers to any properties, and for example control a head turn from a single value like the X position of a controller or a slider.\n\nThe child property has to be prepared with keyframes, and the master property will drive this animation a bit like if you were using time remapping on the slave property, in a similar way to the \"set driven keys\" in Autodesk Maya.\nWhen the master property value is at the predefined minimum, the child property value is the one at the start of its animation, and when the master property value is at the predefined maximum, the child property value is at the end of its animation.\n\nProperty types handled by the connector\n\nAs the connector uses the same principle as time remapping, it is able to connect almost any type of property to any other type of property, which makes it a very powerul tool, even on older versions of After Effects.\n\nThe slave property can be of any type which can be animated with keyframes and have an expression (numerical and spatial values, shapes, texts...)\n\nThe master property must be of a type which is numerical (but can be multi-dimentionnal), like sliders, angles, position, scale, colors...\n\nHow to set the connector up\n\n1. It is advised to first add the needed keyframes on the slave property, though this can be done or modified afterwards. Just animate the slave property as you need it to change when the master property goes from its minimum to its maximum.\n2. a. Select the master property in the timeline, and click on \"Pick Master Property\". The name of the master property will be shown on the button.\n    b. You can also use one of the three controllers of Duik espacially made to be used by the connector (the slider, the 2D slider and the angle)\n3. Depending on the type of the master property, you can select the axis (or the channel if it's a color) to be used to control the slave properties.\n4. Choose between the value or the velocity of the master property to control the slave properties. Using the velocity can be very useful for example to control how the antenna of a car rotates depending on the speed of its X position.\n5. Set the minimum and maximum value of the master property.\n6. Click either on \"Connect to selected properties\" or \"Connect to selected layers opacities\". The latter can be used to control the display of a bunch of layers with a slider: it's a good way to switch predefined phonemes for a mouth with a controller for example. It is exactly like using time remapping on a composition containing a layer sequence, but without all the issued caused by using actual time remapping.\n\nAfter these few steps, everything is ready: as soon as the master property changes, the slave properties will be driven. You can change all the settings afterwards in the effects of the master layer.\n\nIf you need to adjust the keyframes on the slave properties, you can temporarily deactivate the connector by disabling the corresponding connector effect on the master layer.\n\nExamples\n\nAutomating the cloth when the arm bends:\nWith an arm already rigged, made of shapes (either shape layers or masks on solids):\n\n1. Animate the rig so the arm is straight at the beginning of the comp, and bent at its maximum a couple seconds later. If it's possible, animate only the FK of the forearm so the animation is the most simple possible, and to isolate the effect of the forearm on the cloth only, as its just a reference to draw the shape of the cloth.\n2. Animate the shape(s) of the arm and forearm so the cloth looks nice during the whole animation. Feel free to add as many keyframes as needed and use eases!\n3. Select the rotation property of the structure of the forearm. This is the property which exposes how the arm is bent, no matter what, in FK as in IK.\n4. Clicl on the \"Pick master property\" button of the panel of the connector.\n5. Set the minimum to the rotation value of the structure of the forearm at the beginning of the composition, when the arm is straight.\n6. Set the maximum value to the rotation value of the structure of the forearm at the end of the animation, when the arm is completely bent.\n7. Select the shape(s) used to draw the cloth (and now animated).\n8. Click on the \"Connect to properties\" button.\n9. Now you can remove the animation of the arm (but NOT the animation of the shapes which is needed by the connector)\n10. You're all set! Now you can animate the arm as you wish, the cloth will correctly adjust.\n\nControlling a head turn:\nWith a precomposed head:\n\n1.

This is especially useful when there are a lot of layers for the rigs, and if you want to render proxies for character animations in order to improve performance when compositing the shot.\n\n- Just select a precomposition layer containing a rig, and click the \"Extract Controllers\" button to copy the controllers to the current composition and be able to animate outside of the rigged precomposition.\n\n## Edit controllers\n\nIn the edition panel, you can adjust the appearance of the Controllers (Normal and Expert mode).\n\nAll changes made in this panel will affect all selected Controllers and the creation of all other Controllers.\n\n- You can change the size of the Controllers, either automatically, relatively to the size of the composition (small, medium and large options), or with an absolute value (custom option).\n\n- You can change the color of the Controllers: if you click on the colored label, a color picker will be shown, but you can also set your own hexadecimal color code in the text field. A random button will set a random color.\n\n- You can pick the selected Controllers appearance with the \"Get\" button, and set the parameters to the selection with the \"Set\" button.\n\n- The \"Bake Appearance\" button will remove all expressions used by the Controllers to set its appearance. This will improve the performance of the rig, but you will not be able to change the appearance afterwards.\n\n- You can choose to use shape layers (with icons and visual feedback) or simpler null objects to create controllers by default when using the rigging tools.";

And of course, they can be easily personnalized, the user being able to change their colors and shapes as they wish.\n\nThe controller panel consists of the list of controllers shapes you can use in your rigs (or which are created with the tools like the Auto-rig), and some useful tools related to controllers.\n\nThere are 3 special shapes: the slider, the 2D slider and the angle controllers.

var riggingHelp = "To make the rigging process easier and more versatile in After Effects, Duik Bassel introduces the 'Structures' which are very similar to bones or joints in 3D softwares.\n\nThe process can be summarized in just a few words:\n\n1. Structure\n    a. Create Structures\n    b. Link layers\n2. Controls\n    a. Auto-rig\n    b. Constraints\n3. Animation\n\nStructures are layers you can add in your composition which will drive the animations, like the rig of a real puppet. The process is very simple: create or import your design in After Effects, add Structures and move them to the right spots (the pivots of each limb). Then you can rig those Structures, instead of the design itself like in previous versions of Duik, and finally link the design layers to the corresponding Structure layers.\n\nThis way, the rig you create is independant from the design. This means it’s easier to adjust the design even after the rig has been made, or even to re-use the same rig with other designs. Also, this rigging process is easier to fix or change if ever you need to adjust it even when you’re already in the process of animation.\n\nUsing the autorig, and a set of constraints, what you end with are controllers to drive the animation. You animate the controllers, they drive the structures through the constraints, and voilà! Your character moves.\n\nThe interaction between the controllers and the Structures, and between the Structures themselves, happens through some constraints. Some of them are the core tools of Duik since the first version, like IK which drive the bending of limbs, and the Bones which are used to control any spatial properties: puppet pins, the emitter of a particle effect, and, with CC2018 and newer versions of After Effects, any bezier value, like shapes or masks.\n\nThere is also a whole new set of constraints to automate even more movements and make the animator’s life very easier: it’s now possible to animate parenting with the new Parent Link constraint, or to constrain a layer to a bezier path, to attach a layer to other layers using weights, etc.\n\nThe rigging panel is divided into categories corresponding to this rigging process:\n\n- Structures: create and edit structures.\n- Constraints: (auto-)rig the structures, with IKs, the connector, parent links, bones, constraints...\n- Automations: add some automatic motion to properties (wiggle, spring...)\n- Controllers: create and edit nice and easy-to-use controllers.\n- Miscellaneous tools: renaming items, searching and replacing texts... is no longer a pain in After Effects.";

var settingsHelp = "There are a few settings you can change in Duik Bassel to better set it up for your taste.\n\n- You can set a specific file to store the settings, which will be shared by all instances of Duik (all After Effects versions), and which you can store in a synchronized folder between several computers, to have the same settings everywhere. You can also simply copy this file to any other computer to transfer the settings.\n\n- You can change the language of Duik to one of the available ones, or you can contribute with your own translation (https://github.com/Rainbox-dev/DuAEF_Duik/wiki/Translation).\n\n- There are three different modes for the user interface, depending on your level:\n  - 'Rookie' is the simplest one, recommended if this is the first time you use Duik Bassel. Only the most used and simplest tools are available, and the user interface is thought to be as easy to use as possible.\n  - 'Standard' has all the tools available, in a nice and easy-to-use user interface.\n  - 'Expert' is the smallest mode, and may be a bit more complex to use as there are less texts to explain what do the buttons do.\n\n- You can switch between a 'Normal mode' and a 'Dev & Debug mode'. You should always stay in 'Normal mode' unless you're making changes in the code of Duik or if you have been asked to in order to find the source of a bug.\n\n- Click on the 'Apply changes' button to apply any change you've made in the settings.

It can be a game engine, another animation software, conversion to a web animation format... It's up to you, if you know a little bit about writing scripts.\nThe format is not yet documented, but easy to understand just by reading the file. It is very close to how animations are stored in After Effects.\n\n## Rig\n\nNote: Still in development\n\nExports rig descriptions to a JSON file, which is an open format very easy to work with. You can then re-import these rigs in After Effects using Duik, or develop your own tools quite easily to parse them in any other software. XML format may be added in a future version.\n\n## Audition\n\nIf you have some layers with audio in After Effects, you can export the audio to Audition using this tool.\n\nDuik will build a multi-track session in Audition, creating one clip for each layer with audio in the composition. Audio in precomposition is not supported (yet).\nAudio levels and their keyframes will be transfered to audition too, but if the channels (left and right) do not have the same levels, only the average level will be set in Audition.\n\n- Audio Active Only: check this to export only the layers with audio enabled. If it is unchecked, muted layers will be exported too.\n- Transcode and conform media: if this button is checked, Duik will use ffmpeg to extract audio from videos and conform the files before importing them in Audition. This is the best way to import any format, but the media files used in Audition will not be the same than the media files used in After Effects. There is no loss of quality, as Duik will create uncompressed PCM audio (*.wav) matchnig your settings.\n- Open session in Audition will automatically launch Audition and open the file after the export is complete.\n\nWhen you click the 'Export' button, you will be asked to save the Audition session file (*.sesx).

var structuresHelp = "'Structures' are layers you can add in your composition which will drive the animations, like the rig of a real puppet. The process is very simple: create or import your design in After Effects, add Structures and move them to the right spots (the pivots of each limb). Then you can rig those Structures, instead of the design itself like in previous versions of Duik, and finally parent the design layers to the corresponding Structure layers.\n\nThis way, the rig you create is independant from the design. This means it’s easier to adjust the design even after the rig has been made, or even to re-use the same rig with other designs. Also, this rigging process is easier to fix or change if ever you need to adjust it even when you’re already in the process of animation.\n\n == Tools ==\n\n • Hominoid: creates a standard biped 'Structure'.\n • Arm: creates an arm 'Structure'.\n • Leg: creates a leg 'Structure'.\n • Spine: creates a 'Structure' for hips, spine parts, neck parts and head.\n • Custom: creates a custom 'Structures'.\n\n • Toggle edit mode (Normal and Expert mode): disables the parenting of all the children of the selected 'Structure' element to be able to move it without affecting the other elements.\n • Select structures: selects all 'Structures' found in the composition.\n • Duplicate: duplicates the selected Structure.\n • Show/hide: Shows or hides all (or selected) 'Structures' found in the composition.\n\n • Edit... (Normal and Expert mode): opens the edition panel for 'Structures'.";
