The "Move Away" tool will add a simple cursor which controls the position of the layer. This cursor will control the distance between the layer and its parent.

1. Select the layer
2. Click on the "Move Away" button

The value added in the effects of the layer can be used to move the layer along a virtual line passing through the anchor point of the layer and the anchor point of the parent.
