The "Swing" can be used to animate a regular swing. For example, the regular blinking of a light or a pendulum.

1. Select the properties
2. Click on the "Swing" button

The Swing can be adjusted in the effects of the corresponding layer.

By default, the swing uses an exact sinus and goes back and forth very smoothly. Using the "Ease" value, you can add some ease at the extremes and make it slow down and accelerate more.

If the swing is set on a spatial property, you can change the orientation of the motion with the "Angle" value.
