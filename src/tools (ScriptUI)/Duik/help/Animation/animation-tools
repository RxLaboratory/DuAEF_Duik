Duik Bassel includes some powerful tools you may need from time to time during the animation process.

- 'IK/FK Switch' is an easy way to switch between IK and FK during the animation, if the layers have been rigged by Duik Bassel.
- 'Animation Blender' is a nice shortcut to list and animate with markers on compositions previously rigged by the Animation Blender.
- 'Motion Trail' displays the trajectory of any layer using a shape layer, and can make trails behind them.
- 'X-Sheet' is a simple way to adjust the animation exposure of the properties, the layers or the whole composition.
- 'Time Remap' is a quick way to activate time remapping on the layers while adding some useful expressions, like looping.
- 'Extract Controllers' will extract the controllers from the selected precomposition and copy them in the current composition, to be able to animate outside of the character precomposition.
- 'Cel Animation' is a tool to animate frame by frame using the paint effect in After Effects.
