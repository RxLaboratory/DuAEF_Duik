You can copy and paste animations from several layers at once, and from one composition to another.

By default, the Copy and Paste tools will work exactly like the default copying and pasting in After Effects (except it works on several layers at once).

If, when pasting, Duik can not find any corresponding layer to paste some properties, you will be prompted to choose (or ignore) the layers yourself. The dialog will show the names of the missing layers along with some selectors to set the layers where to paste the animations.

## Additionnal panel

Some options make this tool very powerful and more than just a standard copy and paste process.

- You can choose between pasting absolute or relative values. Absolute will paste the keyframes as they are, but Relative will offset the values before pasting, depending on the current values of the properties.

- You can reverse the keyframes in time each time you paste them, to make it easier to loop some keyframes in "ping pong" mode.

- You can automatically replace all existing keyframes, removing any pre-existing animation before pasting.
