The "Kleaner" is a tool to automatically clean the selected animations. It is able to remove unneeded keyframes, clean the interpolations, etc.

## Description

It works both on spatial interpolations and keyframe eases, in three default steps:

1. Fix spatial interpolation: the "Kleaner" will detect spatial tangents which should not be there, for example when two successive keyframes are exactly at the same place but with tangents between them.
2. Smooth temporal interpolations. The "Kleaner" will adjust the animation curves to make them as smooth as possible, automatically detecting the best velocities and eases. It works a bit like the "Auto-Bezier" feature in After Effects but... better.
3. The "Kleaner" will remove all unnecessary keyframes, keeping the exact same animation but with less keys.

## Use

1. Select the keyframes of the animation you want to clean.
2. Click on the "Kleaner" button.

## Additionnal Panel

The additionnal panel is divided in three sections corresponding to the three steps of the "Kleaner " process.

- Spatial Interpolations:
  The four leftmost buttons can be used to quickly change the tangents of several spatial keyframes at once.
  Check or uncheck the checkbox to activate or deactivate this step when you run the "Kleaner"
- Temporal interpolation smoothing:
  Use the two leftmost buttons to tell the "Kleaner" if the first and last keyframes of the animation have to be linear or with ease.
  Check or uncheck the checkbox to activate or deactivate this step when you run the "Kleaner"
- Remove unnecessary keyframes:
