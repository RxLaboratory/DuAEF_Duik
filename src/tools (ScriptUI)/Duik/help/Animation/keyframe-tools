The 'Keys' panel contains all tools you may need all the time when in the process of animation.

- The topmost button, 'Select keyframes...' is a very useful tool to quickly select a lot of keyframes together in the timeline.

- Just under the 'Select keyframes' button, there are several tools to quickly adjust the interpolations of the selected keyframes.
  - The first line of buttons can be used to change the interpolation type of the keyframes, or add keyframes of the wanted type on the properties. With the first button on the left, you can switch between the 'Edit' mode and the 'Add key' mode.
  - In 'Standard Mode', you can manage some interpolation presets, which store and reset velocity and ease.
  - The two sliders and the percentage adjust the ease on the selected keyframes, while the value just below defines the velocity.

- The Kleaner is a tool to automatically clean the selected animations. It is able to remove unneeded keyframes, clean the interpolations, etc.

- You can copy and paste animations from several layers at once, and from one composition to another.
