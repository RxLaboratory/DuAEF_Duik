Duik can import traditionnal animations made with Krita, without needing to export frame sequences or video.

Duik will keep all layers and the animation exposure/timeline from Krita.

1. Export the animation from Krita as a CSV file. Krita will also create a subfolder with the exported layers and frames.
2. Click on the "Krita" button in Duik.

Duik imports all the layers and frames from Krita and then creates a composition corresponding to the Krita project with the same layers and parameters.
