Hominoids (Hominoidea) are a branch of tailless anthropoid primates native to Africa and Southeast Asia.
They are distinguished from other primates by a wider degree of freedom of motion at the shoulder joint.
There are two extant branches of the superfamily Hominoidea: the gibbons, or lesser apes; and the hominids, or great apes (orangutans, gorillas, chimpanzees, humans).


This tool will create a 'Structure' for a complete hominoid with a spine, two legs and two arms, using the settings of the individual limbs in the 'Structures' panel.
