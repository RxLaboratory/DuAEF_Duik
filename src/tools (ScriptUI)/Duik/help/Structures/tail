Create a 'Structure' for the tail of any animal.

Click the '+' button to adjust the settings for the tail.

You can divide the tail in as many layers as you want.
The autorig will adapt to every configuration.

NOTE: In the Autorig options, you can chosse between rigging tails using Bezier IK controls or FK (with automatic follow through and overlap) controls. The latter achieves a natural motion more easily, but IK could be needed in some cases, like if the tail interacts with anything else.
