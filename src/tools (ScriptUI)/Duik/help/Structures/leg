Create a 'Structure' for the (back) leg of a biped or a quadruped.

Click the '+' button to adjust the settings for the leg.

1. Select the type of limb you are rigging:
  - Plantigrade: Animals who put the whole foot on the ground, with the heel touching the ground when they walk. Includes primates, bears, rabbits... The ones nearly equal to humans.
  - Digitigrade: Animals who walk on their fingers. Includes dogs and all canines, cats and other felines, dinosaurs, walking birds... The friends of humans.
  - Ungulate: Animals who walk on the tip of their fingers, who usually have hoofs. Includes horses, cattle, giraffes, pigs, deers, camels, hippopotamuses... The ones humans eat.
2. You can check which part of the limb is present on your character. The autorig will adapt to every configuration, but using all of them can ensure a nice rig and a more realistic animation (with a proper foot roll).
