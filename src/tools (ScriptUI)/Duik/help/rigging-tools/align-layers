The "Align Layers" tool is a very simple way to align layers together.

It is able to align any layer to any other layer, even if they do not have the same parents.

1. Select the layers to align.
2. Click the "Align" Button

The layers will be aligned to the one you selected at last.

In the additionnal panel, you can choose to align only in position, orientation or scale or even to align opacities (set the same opacity value).
