Duik is a comprehensive tool set for rigging and animation. This means there are a lot of tools available, but they are categorized in some useful panels, depending on what you're doing (animating, rigging, using cameras...)

Each panel can be displayed by clicking on one of the top buttons.
The first button, on the left, opens a very simple yet useful notes editor.

The other buttons display the available panels:

- Rigging
- Animation
- Camera
- Import and Export tools
- Settings
- Help

Help

If you need help, click on the top right button to oepn the contextual help, or hold the [Shift] button on your keyboard while clicking on any button to get some help.
