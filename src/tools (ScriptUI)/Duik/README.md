## Supported versions of After Effects 

### Tested

Duik has been tested and is working with all versions of After Effects since CS6. That means it works correctly on:
CS6 (11), CC (12), CC2014 (13), CC2015 (13.5), CC2017 (14), CC2018 (15), CC2019 (16).

Note: CS6 has a lot of issues with Script Panels like the one used by Duik. Duik will work on CS6, but you may have to close and re-open it often to fix the UI issues you may have... You also have to know that the performance is pretty poor with CS6.

### Untested

Note that it may also work on CS4, CS5, and CS5.5 but we do not test it on these versions. Just try if you still use one of those.

### Not supported

All versions before CS4 won't be able to correctly run Duik, sorry! Time to update...

## Installation

There are different ways to install Duik, depending on your version of After Effects and if you have administrator privileges on your computer.

First, download the latest official version there: https://rainboxprod.coop/en/tools/duik/

### Without installation

You'll always be able to run Duik without even installing it. This is a good way to use it if you do not have administrator privileges on an older version of After Effects.

- Unzip all the files in any folder.

- Launch After Effects, and start Duik via the `File/Scripts/Run script file...` menu.

### Preferred way: for all versions of After Effects, with administrator privileges

To install Duik, you just have to unzip the files to the ScriptUI Panels of After Effects.
Keep in mind that with these versions of After Effects, you will need administrator privileges to install Duik.

- Unzip all the files in any folder.

- Copy all the files to the ScriptUI Panels folder:
    - Windows: `C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe After Effects CC\Support Files\Scripts\ScriptUI Panels\`
    - Mac OS: `/Applications/Adobe After Effects CC/Scripts/ScriptUI Panels`

- (Re)Start After Effects, Duik is available in the `Window` menu.

### CC2018, CC2019 and other more recent versions without administrator privileges

If you don't have administrator privileges on your computer but you're using a recent version of After Effects, you can install Duik this way.
Note that some features using third party tools, like transcoding sound when exporting to Adobe Audition, may not work correctly.

- Mac OS: Holding the [Option] and [Shift] keys, drag and drop the file `Duik Bassel.jsx` onto the project panel.

### CC2019 and other more recent versions without administrator privileges
