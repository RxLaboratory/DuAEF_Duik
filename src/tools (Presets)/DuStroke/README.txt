To use the preset, you just have to apply it to an empty text layer, and it works on all versions of After Effects since CS6!

F.A.Q.

- There are issues when I switch the shape, in the stroke options.

Change the font of the text layer to make it work better. Times New Roman is the recommended font on Windows for the preset to work properly.

- The stroke disappears when changing the shape/the shape count.

Unfortunately, there is a strange limitation in After Effects for the count of characters in the same line of text in a text layer. Reduce the count to fix the issue (the Quantity property below the Shape selection).
