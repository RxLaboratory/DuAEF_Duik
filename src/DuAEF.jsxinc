/**
 * To use the Duduf After Effects scripting framework, just include one of those three files in your script:<br />
 * - <code>build/DuAEF_full.jsxinc</code> is the best option if you do not know what to choose. It will include the whole framework with all dependencies.<br />
 * - <code>DuAEF.jsxinc</code> will include all files independently, you'll have to keep all files inside lib/ and bin/ for it to work. This is a good option if you plan to make some changes to DuAEF.<br />
 * - <code>build/DuAEF_no_bin.jsxinc</code> will include everything but the binaries, this file is way lighter than the "full" version.<br />
 * - You can also rename one of these file to *.jsx and put it in the Scripts/Startup/ folder of After Effects to make the DuAEF object available for all your scripts without inclusion.<br />
