# TODO

## Duik

- [x] re-build a simple shapeToJsxinc script (ask for the var name)
- [x] include the 'shape_linker' pseudo effect as `Duik.PseudoEffect.PATH_PIN`
- [x] include the 'bone' pseudo effect as `Duik.PseudoEffect.PIN`
- [x] Re-design pin shapes, export, include
- [ ] Change bone anchor to a single dot, like pins, but add a plain circle always visible in the link

## DuAEF

- [ ] when alerting debug info, actually throw error if javascript debugging in Ae is on

## Notes

Warning: `Duik.Pin.rigPath` now returns the effects, not the layers. The layers can be retrieved from the effects.
