# TODO

- separate the OCO API from DuAEF (WIP)
- Implement bone size (0 by default) (and show envelop if size is not 0)
- toComp() progressbar
- implement limb hierarchy in OCODoc.fromComp
- update Duik autorig to use Duik.Bone.getLimbs()
- update Duik autorig to respect limb hierarchy

## Notes

Snake rig: a standard head + tail, but with an option to select a path control (new kind of Duik controller which includes a path). When path control is selected, an option to set the snake length, a movement along path + path offset.
-> use this for tails too ?
