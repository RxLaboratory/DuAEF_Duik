# TODO

- Autorig: before rigging limbs, set their rotation to 0
  - unparent all
  - set rotation to 0
  - reparent?
- DuSan up time no warning
- Kleaner follow through wrong flex between keyframes

## Notes

Snake rig: a standard head + tail, but with an option to select a path control (new kind of Duik controller which includes a path). When path control is selected, an option to set the snake length, a movement along path + path offset.
-> use this for tails too ?
