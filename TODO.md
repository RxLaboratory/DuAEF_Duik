# TODO

## DuAEF & DuESF

- [x] Add random button to the color selector
- [ ] option to hide options button in all modes.

## Notes

Warning: `Duik.Pin.rigPath` now returns the effects, not the layers. The layers can be retrieved from the effects.

Snake rig: a standard head + tail, but with an option to select a path control (new kind of Duik controller which includes a path). When path control is selected, an option to set the snake length, a movement along path + path offset.
-> use this for tails too ?
