# WIP

- [x] re-build a simple shapeToJsxinc script (ask for the var name)
- [ ] include the 'shape_linker' pseudo effect as `Duik.PseudoEffect.PATH_PIN`
- [ ] include the 'bone' pseudo effect as `Duik.PseudoEffect.PIN`
- [x] Re-design pin shapes, export, include

## Notes

Warning: `Duik.Pin.rigPath` now returns the effects, not the layers. The layers can be retrieved from the effects.
